            "34 hearthstone gaming Hello fellow HS players. My name is Kyle. I have been playing video games since I was a kid with a gameboy and I am 19 now. I have a compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and have issues with moderating what I do. I used to be addicted to heroin. I find that I am getting sucked into Hearthstone too much and I feel like it is taking me away from my real life as much as I am in denial to say so....\n",
            "\n",
            " This game is mindblowingly fun ain't it? Only one problem though is that I am hopelessly addicted. I find that I never get bored of this game. This is my first real TCG and I am hooked. I play HS around 5-8 hours everyday. I am a student however I usually avoid doing homework until like after midnight because I am so consumed by this game.... I know that a lot of you might say then don't play or suck it up! It is hard for me though :/ I've uninstalled battle.net client twice and still come back to it..\n",
            "\n",

I usually grind dailies and go straight to arena. That's my favorite, however sometimes I lose all my gold and have to grind harder. \n",

            "Anyways... sorry for rambling. My weekend starts today and I just wanted to see if anyone can sympathize with me? I really want to be more productive in my real life and enjoy Hearthstone at the same time... but it ain't easy for me :( \n",

            "Thanks man I'll be sure to pm you for help! I am glad you understand addiction, are you addicted to hearthstone? Or have u learned to control urself :pI wouldn't say I'm addicted to Hearthstone, I can control my gaming quite well and usually call it quits when I get frustrated of faceroll hunters. :)  I do have a couple of friends with substance abuse problems, and have gone too far with drugs myself as well from time to time so my knowledge comes from there.As hard as it is, you have  to do what makes you happy or more importantly what IS going to make you happy.  If after this weekend of playing 10 hours of Hearthstone you can honestly look yourself in a mirror and say \"I am happy with what I did and I am still continuing my life forward\" then honestly go for it.  But if there is any hesitation that it is either not as rewarding as other things you could be doing , going out with friends / finishing up projects / getting involved with your school , OR it is impeding your ability to accomplish your long term goals like being a musician / graduating from college / finding someone special than maybe you should reallocate your time.  If you ever want to talk about depression or anything around that feel free to add me Blinky#1888 I can definitely sympathize. I am 40 with many of the same disorders and lack of social life (work 7 days a week). I wish I could offer good advice here but I wish you the best. Knowing that you have a problem is the first step. Let's overcome this together!I'm also a chronic procrastinator. I'll do it tomorrow. Hi kyle, you're not alone in this. I haven't been this into a video game in a very long time and I just can't find the reason why. I also have finals in a week and I'm still playing..Hey man you aren't alone let's conquer this addiction and learn to moderate!I would say lock up your computer or take an enforced break for some time. Give a friend your power cable or something. Just a week or something. The brain is a wonderful (and complicated) thing and I'm sure it will figure out another way of keeping you entertained - even if this is to make your own hearthstone set out of paper or something!\n",

Kha'Zix' Evolved Q now has THE highest AD-Ratio on isolated targets making 800 - 1000 Damage to one target regardles of their health.

My first game ended as 11/11. My teammates lost hard in lane and fed, I had 11 out of my team's 12 whole kills. The second game was a lot better. At the beginning the other team was down 2-3 players due to lag but eventually it evened out and both teams were 5v5. I went about 20/10 with some assists. I could pretty much delete anyone on the other team except for a smart, fed Viktor. \n",

She's not bad enough to waste a refund on. She is still very strong after a couple items, but her laning phase imo feels very underwhelming, but you're probably not in diamond tier so other adcs probably won't be harassing you as much. Lucian is easier to learn than Vayne, mechanically he seems more complex, but in practice its a lot easier to get the hang of him compared to Vayne.\n",

            "* If you get a Hydra, there is a trick you can do with gromp. By standing next to the wall where the Gromp is, you can use the Hydra active to make it aggro onto you and auto you over the wall. This gives you vision of the gromp and you can jump over with your E onto the gromp and escape (or chase). This works for all champs, but it's important for champions like Talon whose jump/blink is a click and point ability. About your third tip. This also works on blue buff if you use your w on it, the little sentries will attack you and give you vision.You can do it with blue buff and raptors as well with Hydra (certainly on Wukong), and I would imagine W works for all of them too.It doesn't really have a use on raptors since the raptors have a pretty small AA range so they have to walk to get to you and by then you won't cover a lot of distance with your E.

The earth's atmosphere sort of breaks up the waves of color in a similar fashion as a prism. But blue being the shortest wavelength is actually the easiest color to see in the sky. The moon doesn't have any of that in the sky it's basically moon surface and space. so you see only the darkness of space as you look out from the moonIf the Earth didn't have an atmosphere, we too would have a black sky at daytime (also we wouldn't be able to breath, so that would be bad :P).

For example, Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234. The rate of this decays depends on the stability of the nucleus, some take thousands or millions of years, some take hours or minutes.\n",

            "Oh okay that makes sense now. Thanks man!If you have one atom of a radioactive substance, then at any given moment it could suddenly decay - turn into another element and throw out some radiation in the process. This process is random, but the average time it takes for this to happen is the same for all atoms of the same substance[1]. There are a few ways to express that average time, but one way is to look at the time it takes to have a 50% chance of decaying, and that's a \"half-life\".\n",

            "If you have a lot of atoms - say, on the order of trillions, then the random behaviour starts looking more like an average behaviour. So if you start with a trillion atoms, after one half-life the number that will have decayed is very close to half a trillion (and the difference probably isn't worth measuring). After two half-lives, another half of the remaining atoms will have decayed, leaving you with a quarter of a trillion atoms of the original substance and three-quarters of a trillion worth of decay products[2].\n",

But if you flip a trillion coins, it would be overwhelmingly unlikely that the number of heads would deviate from half a trillion by more than, say, a hundred thousand.

Then AA him every chance you can lvl 1 - 3/4 to shove him out of lane.  He gets behind exp and CS.  Take him down pre-6 and make sure your E reflexes are good. If they are, you can turn around his R-Q combo because you wont be silenced and you can hit him with QW+AA's and it should do a pretty decent chunk of damage. Landing another QW should allow you to ult and kill him most of the time. If your not sure you can get your E's off in time, ask for early ganks.

I don't actually know how to not bottom out so yeah...Blues are the loudest out of the ones I've used.. by quite a long way!Ahh ok thx!I know some stores have demo products out, doubt you can actually try out games though.My keyboard is actually a demo product, which is why I got it quite a lot cheaper. The only reason it was a demo product was because of the package being slightly damaged. The keyboard itself was completely new and shiny! If you can find a demo product you should definitely look into buying one, saves you a lot of money!brown switches on a das keyboard, they arent too loud, work perfect especiall yin college, and you can get a student discount if you mail them a picture of a student i.d.Get  Ttesports Meka G1, best keyboard ever. That's the one with the GIANT wire right? lolyeaWe have a big SC II scene here where I live and most of the top players use this keyboard.  Mostly because they won it at the CSL last year but it has been great advertisement because I notice lots of players buying them now.Its entirely about opinion. I have a 6Gv2 with blacks and love it, while my friend has White alps that are clickier than hell and he really likes those. I have no trouble typing and he has no trouble with FPS. Try them both out.  Dont get a BlackWidow. If you do wind up liking blacks, get a 6Gv2. They are less expensive and the difference in quality is negligible. Also consider getting something like a [tenkeyless leopold.](http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,tenkeyless)just curious, what's wrong with BWs? afaik they're the cheapest mech board getting around (at least in australia). i find the blues great for both gaming and typing (provided noise isn't a problem). I got the BW over the 6Gv2 and the 7G due to the weird size / position of the Enter and backslash keys (not important for gaming i know, but i use the keyboard for everything). i know a lot of the [pros](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Pro_gear) use them, and so far I haven't had any issues.  I have a Black Widow as well and have not had any problems so far. 2KRO is a bonerkillI have 2 Black Widows and I do not see any issues with them. I do agree with lots of the post here tho about personal preference. Try them both out and then just return the one you do not like.

Its painful for shooters.except that the cluster around wasd doesn't have 2KRO. i have one and have no problems playing an FPS and pressing multiple keys at a time.OOOOOOOkmechanical keyboards can be used for a long time, and the visual design of a blackwidow is not exactly timeless.Yeah I have a 7G (got it used for a little less than a 6Gv2) and I like it a lot, I don't think you can generalize by saying 'black is the the best for FPS, ___ is the best for RTS', etc. Lzgamer/idra/EG guys mostly use the 6gv2/7g as well I believe.Where can you try out mechanical keyboards? I'd love to look into one, but I'm too scared to buy before trying.Depends on where you live, but a retail store like Best Buy or Fry's should have them kicking around.I own a Das Ultimate (Blues) and a Filco Majestouch (Browns), they both perform amazing, :D\n",

I don't really know but where I live a new mechanical keyboard is way of my budget and the Model M is wonderful compared to rubber domes.I heartly suggest browns, because  you use your keyboard like a typist in rts, as opposed to the way you hold down movement keys in fps, the tactile feedback is very useful. I find my browns to be pretty noisy, but I'm still bottoming out, but I still feel blues would be obnoxiously loud for the people around me. Mechanical keyboards are the bomb, I doubt you would regret any decision you make in regard to one. I doubt das will take the highschool id, I have a das silent, and while it is spectacular, considering it uses the EXACT same keys  as the much cheaper ones I would suggest getting a cheaper keyboard. Remember, the switches are all made by the same company, so it really doesn't matter too much where you get your boardI have a 6gv2... for that much of a discount, it's a great keyboard.

Thus did the death of religion give rise to totalitarianism - just another worship of an abstract and irrational moral absolute; the \"State\" rather than a \"God.\" The unjust aristocratic privileges of minority that the founding fathers so railed against simply morphed into the unjust privileges of the majority in the form of \"mob rule\" democracy - which then morphed back into the unjust aristocratic privileges of the minority in the form of a political ruling class\" Wow, I find it laughable that so many \"skeptics\" in the atheist community are so adverse to skepticism when it comes to government.

If so who's going to pay them?  Are there going to be public roads or are they going to be built by private companies and you pay at a toll booth every few hundred metres? Who's going to regulate the currency? Who's going to regulate safety standards?  Are you happy to hop in a plane that hasn't had to meet safety standards? Or after a few crashes will the invisible hand ensure that dodgy operators don't get any business?  Anarchy is idiotic.Without a state, I'd think your questions would be answered with more questions: Which police force do you want? How much are you willing to pay them? Which roads do you want to travel on, those with frequent tolls or would you rather pay a lump sum monthly or yearly or are there actually toll-free roads because they lead to shops that want your business? Which currency do you want to use? Which businesses comply to the safety standards you trust? Would you fly on an airplane that doesn't meet them?So in this anarchist society there would be multiple police forces and only those who could afford to pay them would be protected? That sounds...interesting.  Multiple currencies as well? That sounds ripe for exploitation and speculation. What's to stop counterfeiting if there's no government to regulate? I guess the banks could send the private police they have on retainer to punish them.

Another way is through donation by businesses.  I'm no central planner, I am not smart enough to be able to see how to control the lives of hundreds of people, much less millions.

If a link is submitted to geek, tech and science, all three of which I subscribe to, and does well in all three then my front page could easily fill up with the same two or three successful submissions.

She wanted to leave the church because even though she was a Christian, she couldn't stand all of the \"you're a terrible wretch\" sort of preaching. She doesn't go to church anymore but still reads the Bible and prays. She recalls being heavily guilted to going back to church, I witnessed a lot of it too.

            "245 disagreement answer Actually, that's a common misunderstanding. DR is additive, not multiplicative, since it is based off your *current* DPS **at that time**, not your ongoing DPS. It does not scale up later as you increase your DPS by other means.  Yes, technically every subsequent DR or EDR after your first is including earlier ones in the calculation, however, by the time you can pull off another EDR, the power of your first one has been reduced to an insignificant figure. So instead of two EDRs being simply 1.1 x 1.1=1.1025 of your current DPS, it's actually more like 1.1 x 1.0000001 = 1.10000011, which in terms of significant figures is practically the same thing as a 1.1 bonus. So basically the best bonus you'll ever get from EDR, assuming you are progressing in significant figures in between uses, is ultimately 1.1x DPS.\n",

            "Source: Searching this subreddit only to find that no one has actually seen the equation in the code where DR comes into play, and subsequently doing numerous tests myself to confirm whether it is multiplicative or additive. You can do the same test. A simple example version is to level every hero to exactly lvl.200 up through Frostleaf, do EDR, level frostleaf to 300, and write down your DPS. Reset, do another run, take everyone to 200, take frostleaft to 300, and THEN to EDR. Your DPS will now be a different number than your first run, meaning that the order of operations matters, henceforth meaning that EDR is additive, not multiplicative.\n",

Following what you are saying, if I decide to lvl frosteaf in order to get next x4, you should get 4*1 + 2.594 - 1 = 5.594 (it means the x4 won't work on the old DR bonus).\n",

Sure you see what you're trying to shoot but you lose so much relative sense of direction which I'd hold paramount.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think the ideal setup here is a board camera for moving the quad around and flying in a way where you know your orientation then have a video switch to switch the input over to the GoPro in the air in a safe location where you shouldn't have to move around too much. This allows you to see what you shoot but also minimize the chance being disoriented by flying through a gimbal.\n",

            "765 question answer I have not read the books yet, but I did read in a AOIAF wiki that the Crownlands could muster as many as 15,000 troops if needed. In the show, a great deal is made of how they are short on troops and overall defenses which eventually makes them resort to the wildfire cache. If I recall correctly, the Gold Cloaks have only a couple thousand men, there are the Lannister household guards, and then I think they arm some commoners. In total they're pretty outnumbered by Stannis. I know Baelish goes and tries to convince the Tyrells to fight for them and Tywin comes with them anyway to relieve King's Landing, but why were the troops in the surrounding area belonging to the Crownland's bannermen never mentioned or sought out? Were they already fighting in Renly/Stannis' camps? I know technically they served Baratheons, but Joffrey, as far as most know, is a Baratheon too. Also, I read that many houses in the region are secretly Targ loyalists so maybe Cersei and Tyrion thought they'd be impossible to convince/buy/rally their troops behind their walls? \n",

If the craving is for salt, try cashews or sunflower/pumpkin seeds. If it's for crunch, try baked crackers, apples or carrots. Don't try to go from potato chips to celery cold turkey, because you won't be able to stick with that.

I can't really taste the difference from normal sugar. So that's a good call. Agave is low on the glycemic index, so I use that instead of honey or corn-syrup when I'm baking or in my tea. Its \"sweeter\" than sugar, but has more calories per serving. So you can use less and it equals out without the same sugar rush.\n",

Maybe this is kind of cosmic or whatever, but when I have time to, I try to force negative energy out of my body with breathing techniques and slowing my thoughts. If I could become more efficient at this, I think it would be really helpful. You've already helped quite a bit by making me think a little more about this.

I learned a lot by reading [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html) (there's a free online version on the page, too!), and since I'm somewhat interested in Zen Buddhism, I do [Zazen](http://zmm.mro.org/teachings/meditation-instructions/) - although I'm sitting not nearly as often as I'd like to. There are a lot of great resources online, like [calm.com](http://www.calm.com/) - even with guided meditations.

If you have more time on the day, try to meditate longer - but if you don't have it, at least do it for this single minute. It's not about meditating for as long as you can before starving, or moving to some transcendental planes. First, it's just about building the habit (this will take about four weeks) and getting the hang of it. The latter depends on your method, maybe you need just an hour to understand it, maybe even months.  \n",

Since I broke my habit streak, I'm back at square one and don't do it every day - this is why it's important to make meditation a habit. ;) While I own a zafu (sitting cushion) and a zabuton (larger cushion for the knees and ankles) in combination with a somewhat fixed place in the house, Zazen is about the sitting itself and can be done without them.  \n",

            "1352 question answer I struggled with depression on a fairly periodic basis in middle school and high school. To put it plainly, it wasn't very fun. When I finally started college, I came with a new attitude and approach to the whole situation. I really wanted to keep things together this time around. I really wanted to be happy for my friends and family. I didn't want to be a burden on the people in my life anymore. So here's what I did.\n",
            "\n",
            "In middle/high school, most of my therapy and efforts were aimed at *curing* my depression. I didn't understand exactly what I was experiencing, but I thought that if I could understand the underlying causes of it, the true nature of my depression, I would have the clues I needed to beat it, ridding it from my system for good. This didn't exactly work. I spent a lot of time essentially exploring my depression, not trying to control it in anyway, but fully embracing it in order to understand it in its entirety. This caused me to become extremely reckless with my life. I was throwing away my chances in school, my friendships and relationships, even leaning towards suicide. As silly as it was, I never tried to fight how I felt. I really believed that this way the only way for me to beat depression once and for all, and that if I could just keep going a little while longer, I would figure out what I'd been missing.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was a failed experiment. There was nothing to find. Maybe it is still possible to \"cure\" depression for good somehow, but I've decided that I'm no longer in a position to go down that road again. That's why in college, I changed my focus completely. Rather than trying to control my depression, I decided that I'd just live with it, while learning to *control* it. But, \"How can one 'control depression'?\" you might ask.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking bad over my life, I realized that the severity of my depression was related to the the nature of the current events of my life. I, like most people, would feel sad when not doing well on a test, or being insulted by a friend, or embarrassing myself. The difference was that my depression would make my reactions even stronger. A \"normal\" person might be sad for an evening. I'd be sad for a week. Furthermore, this prolonged sadness would only beseech more sadness. If I was feeling bad about something that had happened at lunch, I wouldn't be near as motivated to prepare for my test that was in the afternoon, causing me to mess up on that too. It was always like that. A chain reaction of tragic events leading from one to the other. Sometimes this chain was short and easily apparent. Other times it was long and subtle, building up over months before finally culminating in a serious meltdown. I realized that if I were going to be happy, I would need to find a way to control these events, avoiding unhappiness and tragedy more so than your typical person. Like a diabetic must regulate his diet, so too does the depressed person need to \"diet\" his emotions.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I tried to do everything I could to prevent possible depression inducing events. I worked hard in school, at least for a time, out of fear of failure. I knew failure in school would make me sad, so I basically saw it as a health risk to fail. It was imperative that I succeed if I wanted to be healthy. I did my best to avoid close relationships. A break up with significant other might make a normal person cry for a while, but for me, it'd might drive me to be reckless and throw my life away. It was a risk I couldn't afford to take.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now I've been in college for four years. Ample time to analysis the results of my strategy to see whether or not it has been effective. My conclusion: it worked. I've been much happier. I am still depressed, but I've been much happier. I have generally avoided suicidal thoughts. I've managed to keep it together for a long time now, a new record I guess you could stay. But, even still, my struggle continues.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sometimes I think I'm just not equipped to make it in this world. I just don't have the strength for it. I can try to avoid tragedy all I want. When it comes, I can use all the strength I have to try to endure it. Maybe I can make it through today's events, or tomorrow's.  Maybe I can make it a month, a year, 5 years, 10 years, struggling every single day to make it through to the next. But eventually, the depression will win. It's stronger than I am. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't let up. It's never deterred. Past accomplishments and current relationships mean nothing to it. It will never stop hunting me. I don't have the drive of my peers. I don't have the courage either. It seems that no matter what outward changes I make to my lifestyle, I can never make any inward changes to myself, not permanently at least. I will come short, without question. Suicide is not the answer. I just can't do that. Not to my friends or my family. Running away isn't the answer either. There is too much shame in that. To quit, to fail, it would only make it worse. What options do I have left then? All I can do is try to succeed, fail, and endure the consequences. I will live as long as I have to in this world. Unfulfilled and broken, I will probably continue to live on, a prisoner of the depression that has never forgotten about me.\n",

            "I just wanted to rant and ramble. I'm sorry there is no happy ending, but this is /r/depression after all. Did you really expect a happy ending? Well, if you feel unfit to make it through life like I do, just know you're not the only one, and I'd be down to chat.\n",

            "1467 elaboration answer I enjoyed the artwork but the story didn't really do it for me.  Aren't Eternals suppose to be invulnerable?  I don't see how his friends could have died so easily.  Also, if that lady really is Death, I'm not a fan of her guiding Thanos on his journey like this.  I was always under the impression that Death was something that Thanos sought on his own, without any kind of soliciting.  It kind of takes away from his character.  I also didn't enjoy how Aaron wrote his mother with the \"despise my own child\" trope. I remember Thanos making a point in an older comic about the things he did for Death, including something along the lines of \"I killed my own mother, whom gave me birth, for you!!!\" or something like that; so I'd like to think that his relationship with his mother had SOME significance in his life, to the point where it meant something when he offered her up to Death.\n",

            "1537 question answer Portland Center Stage is kicking off a 2 year season of Shakespeare starting with *Othello* and it prompted me to re-read it before I see it in a few weeks. While reading it for the first time since high school I find myself no longer feeling pity for the plight of Othello. I only feel for Desdemona and Cassio- the pawns of Iago. Othello, while manipulated just as much, took to acts of violence with his jealousy. He resolved to use his passions to murder his wife instead of confronting her outright to get the whole truth from her. How do others feel about this?\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there are the themes at play. Many refer to Othello as one of the \"most romantic of Shakespeare's heroes\" while others see him as \"egotistical\" and \"inflammable.\" Is he a true hero? Is Iago the only villain?\n",
            "1538 answer agreement I agree. Desdemona and Cassio are the ones to feel pity for. I would say for sure Othello falls under the category of tragic hero for sure, as the play starts out he is admired and seems like a pretty interesting dude, but he becomes isolated from his friends and ends up killing himself. basic tragic hero stuff. What I find pitying about Othello's character is how he falls for Iago's tricks. I always thought this story was a lot about culture shock for Othello - Good Venetian women dressed pretty showy and promiscuously in that day, quite like prostitutes/corteseans and it was sometimes hard to distinguish the two  so of course I think Othello was going to be easy to manipulate as a foreigner which Iago exploited, and in that sense Othello deserves a bit of pity, but i agree with you, Othello took to acts of violence (which sort of mirrors the image he had set when he was introduced) so he played into Iago's plans. I would consider him a tragic hero. At the end, unlike most tragic hero's, he kills himself in the most gruesome way, ever, which i think was created as a sort of penance for his mishaps - perhaps that makes up for it? I don't know. some background into [venice in shakespeares day](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/culture/shakespearesvenice/) may be of some assistance. \n",

            "1541 elaboration answer I never picked on side or the other, I was merely posing the question. When it comes to suicide in literature, and especially Shakespeare, it all boils down to context and the character participating in the act. I am o the side of Othello's suicide being honorable, but I've met a few who feel he should have faced his fate instead of \"running from it\" by killing himself. \n",
            "1543 elaboration answer You have a point about how Iago is good at imposing language. From the beginning of the play, he's trying to make people view Othello through a racist, xenophobic lens, and there's a really good argument out there that Othello himself internalizes Iago's worldview. In his last monologue, Othello oscillates between describing himself as a defender of Christendom and as a despicable racial other. Othello wants to be a victim, someone whose jealousy has been exploited ('one that loved not wisely but too well') but also thinks of himself as somehow inferior and unworthy because of his racial marked-ness ('like a base Indian, threw a pearl away').\n",

            "1544 answer elaboration In Othello's mind he does confront her, and she denies it to his face. That only makes the problem worse. Iago has him all wrapped up, it never enters his mind that Iago made it all up. \n",

All of my classes have ninja pro and I use plenty of grenades, radar and other methods for killing campers. Or are you saying that it's better to not even try to kill them? What are we supposed to do? Leave them to it? That would only let them run up a bigger killstreak, if nobody even bothers to make life difficult for them. The reason I said I don't care how many times I die is because it is a dangerous job. They have a clear advantage, that is why they do it. Nevertheless I can usually do it the first or second time, the most I would die is probably three or four times, and that is only rarely, and even then the camper could have probably got the same number of kills much more easily anyway, and it's a small price to pay for the huge pleasure of finally owning them.

So fill from each mic is needed, not just the boom. If you record 30 seconds of roomtone BEFORE shooting, then you can record all the mics... but I've never seen this on set. Usually you have to beg for room tone, and it often happens after some or all of the actors are on their way out.\n",
            "\n",
            "So next you ask, what if the boom is used to cut a scene? Surely room tone is useful then. You start with the wide (Sc26_T1) on track one, then you have 26A on track 2, 26B on track 3, and so on based on angles, roomtone shifts, and perspective. You need fill from each angle to make the edit seamless, as 26A might be facing a refrigerator and 26B facing away. The recorded roomtone will likely match one or none of the angles, as mic placement, lights, and ambient sound levels will have changed through the course of shooting the scene.\n",
            "\n",
            "The goal with this approach to dialog editing is to make each track sound smooth on its own, then make all of the tracks sound smooth together. It limits the build-up of noise due to using only what's necessary for a smooth edit. When the re-recording mixer starts his/her predub, this speeds up the workflow immensely and ultimately produces an awesome sounding dialog stem. A single angle/track of tone will probably not be sufficient to make this work. Though I always check it with hopeful ears, most of the time I rely on fill-within-the-takes to cut dialog.\n",

            "2516 other answer Before the latest patch, DDs could pop smoke and go invisible, see targets and invisi-fire. The enemy wonders if you're still in the smoke or retreating to another position if you don't fire. Now, the uncertainty of your situational awareness (fog of war) is in effect. You've popped smoke but can they still see me? Apparently it is possible the enemy can see you. \n",
            "I'm not a DD driver, but I do have the Kutuzov, just to be up front about it. This bug...or intentional reworking of stealth status, as intended by WG I think is brilliant. Think of it as a BB that fires a 9 or 12 round salvo and they all bracket the target, or perhaps three rounds hit but do little to no damage due to RNG. Consider that SA and detection along the same lines. Now DDs have a RNG chance to be spotted sitting in smoke and the captain has no clue whether he's spotted or not. It's a chance you have to take. I think it adds a small amount of realism to the game.\n",
            "Of course, there are now several hundred thousand DD captains not liking this at all, and I can't blame them. If this mechanic is meant to stay, it should have been implemented at the start. Even so, DD caps are going to have to change tactics a bit. \n",
            "And, even though I don't DD, I think this new SA and being spotted in smoke should be a very small chance. I think it happens to often and honestly, that's what Sonar and Radar are for. So I'm liking this implementation...just for the sake of a little more realism...it just needs to be toned down a lot. \n",
            "2517 elaboration answer A couple things.  First is you said you go invis and see targets and invisi-fire. Technically you can't see targets while in smoke.  Someone else has to be spotting them for you.  This can be a ship or a plane.  If no one is spotting the enemy ship for you then while in smoke you can't see anything.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Second, there was a recent post which explains that SA is working as intended, however there is a 2-3 second delay while you're in smoke for you to go invis.  This is reset every time you \"phase\" in and out of the smoke.  So it is very important to make sure you cut your speed prior to smoking up in order to avoid \"phasing in and out of view\" and causing multiple 2-3 second delays for you to go invis.  Especially so on the Kutuzov as that thing takes longer to stop than a DD.\n",
            "2518 elaboration answer There are a lot of people who are pissed about the recent SA spotting mechanic of 5.5.0.  Personally, it has not effected me too much.  As I play Russian DDs as well as IJN.  When playing the Kiev I always assume I am spotted and run and gun, essentially I never stop firing.  That style spills over a little bit in my Hatsuharu (65.22% WR, 30k avg. damage- 46 battles) game-play in that I am not afraid to use my guns and don't rely on never being spotted.  Don't get me wrong I try not to be spotted when in an IJN DD, but I certainly don't count on it.  \n",
            "\n",
            "My advise is to be hyper aware and always have an exit plan as with SA delay, sonar, Radar, and planes there are so many game mechanics in place that can reveal your position and you just have to be prepared to react quickly to get yourself out of a bad position.\n",

            "Sander's is running a legislative platform for the presidency, which is common these days. Many of his proposals would require significant legislative action. For example, Sanders is running a universal education plan would require a significant restructuring of the financial aid apparatus, changes to the revenue code, and likely the creation of a new agency to oversee it. He is also running a major legislative plan to break-up the banks. He is on the record of supporting another major overhaul of the healthcare system, which would likely require a repeal and replace of the ACA. He would like to see significant changes to early-year childcare and regulations on maternity and paternity leave, which would require significant legislative pushes.\n",

            "The problem is, Sanders is not running for a legislative position, he is running for the executive. Every major policy proposal he has put forward would be almost like another ACA, a massive change to existing structures that requires significant coordination with a legislature that is not as committed to the policies as Sanders would be and that is likely to be hostile (even if the Dems make gains during his presidency).\n",
            "\n",
            "That means that most of the 'simple' and 'common-sense' proposals Sanders puts forward in his presidency are, ultimately, out of his hands. He can recommend them, he can find friends in the legislature that help craft the legislation he wants, but ultimately all he can do is apply political pressure. With a hostile legislature, this is likely to lead to a lot of, as /u/Honest_Discussion suggests, 'non-stop gridlock, whining, and finger pointing'. If Sanders is able to get half of his policy proposals through the legislature, they will in the end rely on 'imperfect deals' that resemble the original intent only if you squint hard enough.\n",

            "Sanders, of course, has been a legislator since 1991, so he knows this. He's no straight-talker or common-sense hero. He may have policy recommendations closest to your interests, and if he does than by all means vote for him. But don't expect anything close to the high expectations many will have for him if he wins, because he simply can't achieve it.

But I personally think Sanders will be unlikely to yield these results. He's a populist legislator, and its telling that while he has a lot of big legislative plans he hasn't taken the lead in achieving them in the 24 years he's been there.

            "3419 elaboration answer I play airborne exclusively so I have some pretty polished airborne decks for both factions.  That said airborne is still a frontline deck, just more of a fast attack and then defend playstyle than other frontline decks, so you will prefer support decks if you're looking to avoid direct combat entirely.  There are plenty of other people that can help you build one of those.\n",

The Soviet airborne infantry being available in APCs - especially the halfway decent AA APC the Skhrezhet - is a huge advantage over other airborne infantry. The reason to go USSR is for the prototypes, in an airborne deck you'll have upvetted Ka-50 and Ka-52s which are definitely nice, and the Su-27PU is considered one of if not the very best ASF in the game. I personally prefer general redfor airborne though, which will give you access to more cards of SEAD - critical for an airborne deck - plus really nice units like the B-5 and HQ-7.\n",

            "> In mid-August 2010 ESO Photo Ambassador Yuri Beletsky snapped this amazing photo at ESO’s Paranal Observatory. A group of astronomers were observing the centre of the Milky Way using the laser guide star facility at Yepun, one of the four Unit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n",
            "\n",
            ">Yepun’s laser beam crosses the majestic southern sky and creates an artificial star at an altitude of 90 km high in the Earth's mesosphere. The Laser Guide Star (LGS) is part of the VLT’s adaptive optics system and is used as a reference to correct the blurring effect of the atmosphere on images. The colour of the laser is precisely tuned to energise a layer of sodium atoms found in one of the upper layers of the atmosphere — one can recognise the familiar colour of sodium street lamps in the colour of the laser. This layer of sodium atoms is thought to be a leftover from meteorites entering the Earth’s atmosphere. When excited by the light from the laser, the atoms start glowing, forming a small bright spot that can be used as an artificial reference star for the adaptive optics. Using this technique, astronomers can obtain sharper observations. For example, when looking towards the centre of our Milky Way, researchers can better monitor the galactic core, where a central supermassive black hole, surrounded by closely orbiting stars, is swallowing gas and dust.\n",

            "**Jack** Jennifer Meer, \"Jackie\", \"Cool Pudding Lady\" these are all names that refer to a Shepard Institute cafeteria worker. Abrasive and rude as a convicted felon can get, Jack is \"volunteering\" at the Institute to avoid a trip to the big house. Despite her history, Jackie is often seen delivering food to Tabitha, Jeff, and other children on their treatment days. Jeff noted that each meal came with a cute doodle or a pretty origami crane. When Jeff confronted her about her preferential treatment, Jackie shrugged it off saying that she likes kids, since they're easier to talk to than adults and they understand what she wants. \"I just wanna be free, kid...more ways than one.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**Jacob Taylor**: Jeff's physical therapist is John Tyler. A firm believer in the \"Anyone can better themselves\" mantra, John openly respects and even admires Jeff's optimistic attitude. He chose to be a physical trainer to help kids especially, admitting that he and his father are not on speaking terms. He pushes himself so he can be a better man than his father.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Samara**: Dr. Samantha Rogers is one of the three board doctors that oversee major decision-making at the Shepard Institute. A wise woman who, at times, is kind and motherly and at other times cold and distant. She's respected by the Institute's doctors for abstaining from any favoritism when it comes to breaking of protocol, but she's also feared as she's swift to deliver suspensions for even minor infractions of said medical protocols.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Kasumi Goto**: Mitsune Kiru is a spunky, silver-tongued intern. While she means well and admires what the Institute and its staff does, Mitsune tends to have a very \"laid-back\" work ethic and is often seen cat-napping in the strangest of places. She's almost never caught, much to her ill-conceived pride, and her innocent demeanor and persuasive excuses can even throw off Dr. Rogers at times. Jeff always feels the need to check his pockets, after he talks to her.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Zaeed Massani**: Zach Masters is a rough \"sunovabitch\"...or so he'd tell you. A member of an elite team of Australian soldiers sent to Vietnam during the war, he was the only one of his squad who survived a vicious ambush. He's often seen with Donald, trading war stories. Normally proud and boastful, the proud warrior grows melancholic whenever he mentions a Lt. \"Vido\". He's currently trying to get his old war rifle shipped from Australia.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Legion**: Larry Jenkins was a computer technician before he was admitted to the Shepard Institute to treat his malformed heart. Treatments have only been mildly effective and his doctors told him that he needed a transplant to live past a few more years. His rare blood type and dilated arteries make finding a donor heart extremely difficult, despite this, Larry has already passed up three matching hearts telling himself and his doctors that there are people who need it more urgently than him. Jeff befriends him when they meet in a quiet part of the Institute's gardens. Larry has been continuously trying to befriend Tabitha, but she's frightened by Larry's ghastly, gaunt appearance, convinced he's a ghost or a monster. He confides in Jeff his fear that there's no life after death and his actions in the world could be meaningless.\n",

Although stone-faced, Hackett is infamous for his \"Hack it out.\" joke during his surgical consultations. Hackett takes a shining to Jeff after he talks to the boy about his future surgical options, and Jeff in return finds some comfort that his surgeon can still laugh at his job.\n",

            "**Ken & Gabby**: The inseparable nurse pair are almost always working on paperwork at nurse station three. Even Doctor Nagali acknowledges that they somehow work much more competently together. Ken regularly plays cards with the other nurses, and promises to teach Jeff how to play poker, when he's older. Unbeknownst to the pair, there is rumor that several doctors are betting whether they finally work out that \"unresolved sexual tension\" within the next year.\n",

            "**EDI**: Edith was a miracle born from tragedy. The sole survivor of a tragic aviation disaster, Edith was in a medically-induced coma for five months as doctor's worked to salvage what they could and remove what they couldn't. When she awoke, she was in the sterile white rooms of Shepard Institute, disoriented, unable to move, and alone. Prosthetic limbs still needed to be created, a process of a few weeks, and even then, Edith showed little motivation to do much of anything besides eat, drink, and breathe, let alone go through rigorous physical therapy. Then Dr. T'Soni brought her Joker in; however, to her dismay, Jeff and Edith didn't get along at all. Edith's cold criticisms drawing blood on Jeff's patience. Despite the pleas from Dr. T'Soni, Jeff refused to acknowledge Edith at all afterwards. It was only until Jeff's wheelchair battery ran out outside of her room did the pair finally begin to talk. It was a tense, awkward conversation, until Jeff made his signature snide commentary on the situation. And then a small giggle broke the silence between them. Then a chuckle. Then hardy laughter. Edith was laughing, smiling for the first time in a long time. Jeff would and probably never will admit it, but Edith looked kinda cute when she was smiling. The two would become close friends, helping each other through each others' physical therapy, hoping that, eventually, she can ride on the back of Jeff's wheelchair.      \n",

            "**Javik**: Dr. James Victus is as close to a celebrity as one can get in the Institute. A world-renowned expert on degenerative diseases, Dr. Victus only recently became a member of the Shepard Institute. Dr. T'Soni was initially excited to work with the bespectacled man whose works she studied ever so carefully, but as she continued to observe her idol she realized that Dr. Victus came short of her expectations. He spoke tersely and often relegated most of his patients to other doctors and staff members so he can spend more time in the research labs. Instead of assisting her with oversight of her patients, Dr. Victus constantly criticized and berated Dr. T'Soni for her \"disgustingly unprofessional\" repertoire with them. The pair often fiercely argued over treatment methods and Dr. T'Soni's disappointment and bitter contempt for her fallen idol was not lost on her patients.  However, Jeff notices that Victus does openly acknowledge T'Soni's skills as a physician and often cedes to T'Soni's judgement in their arguments, leaving Jeff confused as to why the pair can't work better together.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Richard Jenkins**: Richard Jenkins only met Jeff once, sitting in a waiting room together they shared a few jokes.  Most of what he knows about the man were from off-hand remarks by Dr. T'Soni. Jenkins was an incredibly spirited young man who was ready to take on the field of medicine with a fresh mind. He worked under Dr. T'Soni for a short time and showed incredible compassion and promise, but when a small yet critical error in judgement caused the death of a patient, Jenkins broke down. While he was granted a reprieve from the board for his mistake, Jenkins received no such atonement from his own conscience and resigned altogether from the Institute. \n",

            "4149 question answer I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm a mtf transgender. I've gotten lots of moral support from my friends, as well as from other subreddits. I know what I need to do, but most of the things I need to do aren't cheap. I can lose weight with support from my parents, because they don't know that I'm losing weight in order to me more appealing and self satisfying as a female, but I can't really afford things like HRT, and I need to begin as soon as possible. I'm 17, and will be able to move out in about 5 months. It would be really ideal to receive support from my parents who have claimed that they'll support me no matter what I do in life. However, they're very conservative Christians that are very unaccepting of anything other than the existence of cisgender men and women being associated. If I were to tell them that I were trans, not only is it possible that I won't be supported, but they may try to work against it. I won't let that stop me, but it isn't optimal. My father has stage 4 cancer, so as bad as it sounds, I was thinking that if I do tell my parents, I'll only tell my mother after/if my father passes away. She's still not likely to be accepting, but if I had to pick one, I would tell her. What do you guys think? \n",
            "4152 elaboration answer That doesn't sound like a bad idea. I only hope that's something she'd be willing to let me go into therapy. Unless she thought it would make me want to change my mind about the transition, I can't see her wanting the insurance to pay for it, and I'm only planning to undertake therapy as a prerequisite to HRT, and based on some research I've done, there are places near me that don't have a therapy letter requirement. There is, however, the possibility of me moving from here (Florida) to North Carolina when I turn 18 to be with some friends. I haven't found out much about the HRT options there though.\n",

People didn't mind as much in the old days because it wasn't abnormal, playing most NES games would mean a few glitches and as long as they weren't too common or too game stopping that was just how it was, also with no internet each person had to independently discover using a p-wing and fighting boomboom meant he would jump off the top of the screen and leave the game unwinnable. \n",
            "4399 elaboration answer Glitches as well as bugs existed, I never said old games was 100% bug-free. However modern games have a much higher count of them than old ones. Some of those are due to the complexity behind modern games but other are because they're a low priority since the dev team knows they can fix them post-release in a patch.\n",

There was kinda an expectation that if you didn't \"play right\" the game would break and that lots of nutty stuff happened because videogames just worked like that and comptuers weren't very good. \n",

            "Games today still have bugs, but not anywhere anything like the old days. Bugs today tend towards balence things or poor preformance under certain circumstances or interface bugs.

            "4404 elaboration answer I think it's more that bugs used to be such a big part of games that it's hard to even really think of them as bugs.

If a game had something like that today people would justifyably be asking how a game could even get released with such a serious bug. I mean not even talking about the fact mario can jump through almost every single wall in the game! (or the glitch that became gameplay that mario can get up and walk around in the HUD). We just used to treat bugs diffrently until there wasn't many, at which point each one became a way bigger deal because the expectation was no longer so 'whatever, it's a bug, there are lots of those\" \n",

But you don't need to go running around on the internet crying out and begging for a new ending. You bought it and that is what you got. Research a game before you invest $60 into it.

General idea is to get Bubbly Derpy to flip early using Backup Vocals, then throw out Philomena to make your opponents lose AT every turn. A bunch of other cards tax the opponent's AT, so that can hopefully lock down the game for them while you farm a problem, both of which are locked down under It's A Trap and Jet Set and Upper Crust.

            "4914 elaboration answer I would say that it is **not** normal for such a young infant to go so long without stooling. This is because the first milk (colostrum) has a laxative effect, which is meant to help baby pass the meconium. After colostrum, you will have transitional milk, and then finally mature milk. It is not until 6-8 weeks that you might see a decrease in the frequency of stooling, which may last until baby starts solids. On the other hand, it is also perfectly normal for a breastfed baby to continue to stool several times per day. Both of my kids were once per week poopers between about 2-7 months, which my doc was perfectly fine with. My kids frequently went 6/7/8 days between poops, and then when it came it would be a monster-sized poop! When I expressed concern, my doc told me not to even call unless it went more than 10 days.\n",

But at 2 months, the median was down to 1 per day, with a range of 1 every 7+ days to 8 per day. The population studied was a Turkish population in which 78% were exclusively breastfed to 4 months, at which point weaning foods were commonly started. When only looking at breastfed babies 0-4 months, the median stooling frequency was 3 times per day with a range of 1 every 7+ days to 12 per day, compared to mixed fed babies who had a median of 1 per day with a range of 1 every 4 days to 8 per day. The conclusion is that overall, breastfed babies had more stools per day than mixed fed babies, *however* it should also be noted that they had a greater *range* of stooling frequency.\n",
            "\n",
            ">The median number of stools per day and ranges in each age group and factors that affect stool frequency are given in Table 3. The most important factor that affected the frequency of defecation was the infant’s age. The most frequent defecation was seen in the first month (median: 6), and this decreased with increasing age (p = 0.0001). The percentage of infants who passed stool less than once a day was very low in infants aged 1 month (0.9%), but this increased sharply at the second month (39.3%). After 4–6 months, it decreased again to 25.6%, 21.1%, and 12.2% at 4–6 months, 9–12 months, and 18–24 months, respectively. The second month was unique in the sense that the frequency of stooling decreased to half of the previous month and **39.3% of these infants defecated less than once a day**. \n",

            ">Almost all studies performed on stool frequency reveal that the number of stools per day in the first month of life is significantly higher than in other months of life [5, 10, 15]. In our study, the median number of stools in the first month of life was 6 (range: 0.5–12). In the second month, it decreased to once a day and remained almost the same until the end of 2 years of life. **Interestingly, in the second month, more than a third of infants passed less than one stool each day.** This finding has been observed in our clinical practice when the parents of these rare-stooling infants applied with the complaint of constipation. These infants were defecating once every 3–4 days, although the stool consistency was normal. In their study, performed on 240 infants aged 2–20 weeks, Weaver et al. demonstrated that the stool frequency decreased to half after the first month both in breast-fed and formula-fed infants [21]. **The high frequency of defecation in early life is thought to be related to immaturity of the gut and breast feeding [8, 21, 22]. The age-related decline in the frequency of stools points toward a maturation of the water-conserving capacity of the gut. The passive permeability and active absorptive mechanisms of the neonatal gut change with postnatal age [21].**\n",

Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind.

            "5813 agreement answer Kurlysoo is right - the milk your body made for baby when he was first born is pretty different than the milk you're making him now. I believe I've read on Kellymom that you do not necessarily need to worry if your baby is eating/drinking what seems to be the same quantity milk for months and months (that is if you're able to measure...my LO gets expressed BM in bottles during the day so I can measure the ounces). If you were feeding baby 4 oz bottles of breastmilk at 1 mo old, for ex., you could still be feeding 4 oz bottles at each feeding when LO is 4 mo old, since your milk will adjust to become fattier to meet baby's growing needs.\n",
            "5814 elaboration answer I'd like to know the answer, also. I don't think it's a stupid question at all. People always say it's a supply/demand system, but also stress the first 2-3 months so much for building up your supply that it makes it seem like you're set at that point. \n",

The 10 minute spoil time only adds more insult, as they will start spoiling before you have finished making them since it takes so long to make a decent amount of them.\n",

            "5820 negativereaction answer Still unacceptable in my opinion. Would rather have them limit the number we can carry by 20 or so, or even 10 if they significantly increase the amount they heal. I don't carry too many, but when I need them, I don't want to suddenly not have them because they have been rotting.\n",
            "5821 disagreement agreement Blood goes bad in real life....so yeah it makes sense that they go bad. The cooldown is a bit much. I was thinking more like 5s not 40s.\n",

He has since eaten a good meal at the breast, so I know he's not going to starve, but I am so frustrated now that I know it is something fairly easy to fix and we are still having to work through/around it for probably another two weeks.  \n",

Like if it were an actual serious medical problem, you would be a responsible parent and do what you have to do! That being said, if they can do the revision ASAP so you have 4 or 5 days before your trip, you should be fine, giving time to make sure there's no abnormal bleeding and baby is adjusting fine.\n",

She eats for half the time she used to, and actually takes in the same amount of milk- my nipples appreciate this! She hadn't been gaining weight and we were supposed to give her formula once a day, but she entirely refused the bottle, and was just spending 40min breast feeding every 2 hours! She wasn't using her tongue to eat at all, and now she is starting to figure out that it's less work when she uses her tongue. Beg and plead with the doctor, tell them he can't eat because he can't latch, and that's a more serious complication than discomfort after clipping.\n",
            "5837 elaboration question This is what I spent yesterday doing, pleading with the doctor.  Unfortunately, I'm finding that with military healthcare there are little options.  They would have to refer out for the procedure, and even with expediting it it'd be a long shot, and since she doesn't agree with doing it before our trip she won't make the effort.  I'm tempted to see if I can find someone privately and do it out of pocket.  That's what I'm looking into now.\n",
            "5838 appreciation answer I wish you the best of luck in getting it taken care of as soon as you can. It would be very shitty of your doc to delay in getting a referral. My pediatrician didn't thing getting my daughters fixed would make a big difference in feeding, but she put the referral in as urgent, so she would be seen within 5 business days. Maybe you can call and talk to a nurse and ask about urgent referral or emergency referral, so you don't have to even speak to the doctor directly. It's worth a shot, at least.  Having my daughters fixed has already made a great difference in only 2 days, I hope you get the same relief!\n",

            "6275 question answer I have 2 week old twins who spent over a week in the NICU. I started pumping the second day after delivery (I had a c section and was quite out of it for a while). They were born at 35.4 weeks, and had trouble eating from a bottle, and even had trouble digesting food from their feeding tubes for most of their NICU stay. I put them to the breast whenever they show they want to try. They're slowly getting better at breastfeeding with the help of a nipple shield. My newest problem is unstable supply! I'm pumping 6 times a day, right after the babies eat their formula/breast milk combo from bottles. As of yesterday I was producing 1 oz per breast, per pumping. Today its dropped to half. Every day I drink 3 cups of mother's milk tea, and I try to pump right after I shower, or when I put a baby to bed after they fall asleep on my chest. I missed one pumping yesterday because I wasn't at home and forgot a pump part (doh!). I need help! Can I use fenugreek with the tea, or is that too much? What about domperidone, I've read a lot of women's opinions on it, would I use it alone, or with fenugreek, or tea? How can I, or when should I put the babies to breast more often without them or myself, getting too frustrated? I'm not giving up this easy, I'm just getting tired of feeling like I'm failing my babies. \n",

I'd like to see something similar for just the past 2 games when we've had a more complete offense.  I know this week 1st and 10 was pretty much always a run or quick screen pass (mostly run) and 3rd and short was pretty much always a pass.  I can't think of a single time that they just went for a intermediate to long passing play on 1st down, I know we have a young team but Shurmur rarely shows confidence in his guys and gives them a chance to wake up with a big/game changing type play.\n",

But if it's a relatively calm lake, then you do see a minor reflection. Look out over a like, particularly where some clouds should be reflected, and you'll see some slight white where the cloud should be reflected (it's not perfectly reflected as the surface is quite rough so light is scattered, though not as bad as a rough ocean would be). This is especially noticeable on the horizon.\n",

Make an ethical thing, the person is trying to do good but others might not see it that way and they aren't willing just to hand the situation to a solar. Make the solar decide between letting things be it using more power than a mortal to force their will on others and play up how similar to the things they fight the situation can be. An evil dragon blood is an easy situation. Too easy in my eyes. I would wager a third circle necromancer could, it makes a player make another hard choice.

They win because they optimize their videos with targeted keywords (they know what their audience is looking for) and deliver with great content.

To feel loved, not only by others but by myself. I realized today that I'll probably be single for the rest of my life, because on my time here, it seems that I've been deemed undesirable by many, so loneliness creeps back into my life day by day. I can feel the end of days approaching and I just want to be alone and cry.  But with that being said, if I'm going to go down, I'm going down swinging.

You continue to rise and fall as wave, but you experience yourself as boundless ocean. This is indeed the whole point of meditation, and it really happens to ordinary people. It's why it's worthwhile taking a little time to sit every day.

From what I understand, the ideal MPI model contains a master process and slave processes which are assigned work. This is the case with my master distributing different loads to the \"zone cluster\", but then it gets a bit distorted from the basic model with the zones accessing the file cluster and the other units. The zones are also not performing completely parallel tasks. This comes up as a concern because it *seems* MPI is more geared for a highly parallel operation, but, in this case, the zone cluster is also doing synchronization operations internally.\n",

Over time more servers may be easily added to the cluster.\n",

I sighed, getting up off the couch and slowly, carefully made my way to the kitchen, opening a cabinet and getting out a flash light, clicking it on and moving the beam across the dark, empty apartment.

The orange and yellow light was no longer pouring out of the windows, but smoke poured out of the crack between the doors. Suddenly, the doors were thrown open and someone fell out, hitting the ground with a groan and a thud. I gasped, flashing my beam on them. It was a man, his clothes in tatters. I frantically fished my phone out of my pocket to dial 911 and frowned as I found it was turned off. \"Weird...\" I thought. I cautiously stepped towards the man, his short, dark red hair blowing softly in the wind. \n",
            "\"A-are you okay sir?\" I asked. He groaned in response. I stepped closer and kneeled, turning him over, shocked to find that despite his clothes being all but destroyed, his face appeared fine. He had a thick red beard, one that hadn't been shaved in several days. His ivory skin was almost too intense to flash the beam of light on.

He turned towards me. \"Can you believe this?!\" he said incredulously, gesturing to the box. I really couldn't. He sighed. \"Well, that's just great.\" He turned toward me again, his eyes narrowing. \"Why do you keep doing that? I don't like it,\" he said. \n",

            "\"If we're in New York City in 2015,\" he said, \"then why are there no lights for miles around?\" He asked. And for the first time, I noticed that it wasn't just my apartment. The city was dark as far as the eye could see. \"My god...\" I said. I turned back towards the man, but he wasn't there. I whirled around to see his slender legs disappearing into my open patio doors. I ran after him. \"Hey! You can't just barge into people's homes like that!\" I said.

Most of their product packaging says \"Designed by Apple in California.  Assembled in China.\"  They design the products with a combination of standard components and custom ones (usually they start with an existing component and modify it slightly, but some things are basically designed from scratch - e.g., their logic boards), and send the designs to their partners for manufacturing.  As I understand it, major car companies like Toyota mostly own their manufacturing plants directly.\n",

We'll provide the engine.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "It may seem like a minor distinction, but it's made a huge difference for Apple in the past.  On the one hand, it keeps their costs down and lets them switch hardware platforms without paying the cost of refitting factories; they can just switch partners to someone already set up for their new needs.  On the other hand, it means their designs are limited by what their partners are capable of selling them.  Apple was stuck trying to squeeze every ounce of life out of the G4 platform because IBM couldn't be bothered even to scale up their G5 production, let alone improve on the design for mobile applications.  \n",

In later episodes, they would never have a disguise at home.

The easiest way to apply this is with right click, which is on a 1 second cooldown due to the animation. If you actually stood there for 3 seconds, longer even (FM never only right clicks, they will always be animation cancelling RMB/LMB with other skills inbetween) to allow him to stack three chill on you, and then allowed him to do it *again* without iframing or counterattacking him then that's your fault. At the very least, you had a whole *six seconds* to do something about it. Learn your own skills and know what they do - any block skill or resist damage skill can prevent them from further stacking chill or comboing you. You have attacking skills too, you can pressure him back.

Let's take Split/Second Velocity destruction (Named Power Play), for example. Some of those events (Like road changes) change the gameplay and the track a lot. I wanted something like that. Plus, small blue power plays are impressive too. While, I repeat, I know BF and this are very different games, let's think you are in a jeep. I want the road to change more than just a few craters. How about Dawnbreaker's Levolution? I liked it, but it was too small of a change. It just brought down a bridge. What I would had liked is one building falling on another one, thus creating a cloud of smoke (That, please, would go away after a while), and making junk on the ground, making more cover for infantry? That is what I would had liked. Like 'the goldeneye dish' 's (Rogue Transmission). I liked the display of impressive destruction, but it really feels like something to showcase in the trailer. Or, one of my last ideas : An EMP explosion, or constant EMP surges. The EMP will make a disable on every vehicle on the map without damage (Not a mobility kill, oh no.), disable RDS and anything related. That would bring diversity if these events were random, not player-triggered.\n",

It's unfortunate to be beaten by a great team early on when you could go further against another team, like 2 years ago with Bayern. Not to say they're a bad team, but if we can't beat Dortmund this season, we don't deserve to be one of the top 8 in Europe anyway.

Even though they don't show Yoda's lightsaber in the original movies, in the prequels Yoda wields a green lightsaber. The kyber crystals the determine the color of a lightsaber's blade are charged by the user. In the EU there are different types of crystals that determine the color of the blade, but I think that it is meant more to symbolize that Luke was following Yoda's teachings of inner peace and forgiveness rather than Obi Wan's urging to kill Vader. \n",

See the footnote under Table 1 for a slightly better explanation of the units they're using. They're reporting exp(f - m) where f and m are the mean log wages for females and males. That means they took wage data, transformed it into logs, averaged the transformed variable by gender, and computed the above statistic.

What exactly do you expect to achieve with a low lottery draft pick?  We won't have anything near the top of the lottery even if we do start to lose.  Is that what you mean by long-term perspective?  \n",

            "2) The belief in Masai Ujiri. A lot of people think he's a saviour with the golden touch and doesn't need high picks to build a winner. Others (myself included) aren't buying into that yet. I think a lot of this stems from how awful Colangelo was. \n",

            "11380 elaboration answer I don't have that source either, but Gabe has said in a few interviews that the episodic model didn't work and they won't be continuing it.  I don't believe it was ever confirmed that the next game would be called HL3 and not episode 3 but it was heavily implied.  Also, Valve never said they were having trouble with motion capture, but a voice actor who has worked for them did.  It makes sense that it would be difficult to get realistic movements that react to the player's movements but I highly doubt they haven't come up with a million possible solutions and they will likely change the industry when they release their solution to the public.\n",
            "11381 appreciation question Thanks for the responses. That's what I figured... 3 years after Episode 2 you gotta start asking yourself how they could pull off Episode 3 and make it long enough to satisfy, in which case they could just spend the time and make the 3rd and final installment as HL3. Seeing as how the gap between HL1 and HL2 was about 6 years that means we should have something 'soon' right\"?? It's always a mystery with Valve..\n",

They had been but outcasts from former empires and from themselves, interacting with each other as sparsely as possible. In light of their tremendous victory, they decided that their power and potential for survival was greater as one nation than many splinter factions.

Only a few had any sense of organizational background, and so chomped at the bit to set up a governmental infrastructure.

If they kept that up it would be getting really repetitive and people would most likely be unhappy with it.

The NRA believes in unlimited gun rights which the Supreme Court has clearly stated doesn't exist as a right under the 2nd Amendment.

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons\".\n",

In the build up to the World Cup that year, the UCL final got a lot more play than it had in the past. A lot of folks I know that were watching were neutrals at the time, and this was their first experience with really top class soccer. Choosing between the two, Arsenal was kind of the go-to for Anglo-Americans, with the cultural ties between the US and UK. On the flip-side of that coin, soccer fans in this country fell in love with Ronaldinho that year, so Barcelona picked up a good many followers that year. \n",

            "This sounds sort of bad, but it really used to be so much harder to watch soccer here. Barely any games on TV, streams were not like they are now. If you supported, say, Newcastle, you would only see them if they played a top four side that week. I remember I chose United probably 13 years ago because a soccer game was on, which never happened, and it was United playing Liverpool. Liverpool just sounded weird (I was 7, give me a break), so United it was.\n",

In some cases it's natural - say if your dad was a British ex-pat who supported Arsenal - but in the vast majority of cases it's often to do with the successful teams at the time and numerous other more minor reasons like the ones I listed above.\n",

Regardless, the population of Inhumans remains small compared to the general  population and tbh the Inhumans of today are very, very ignorant. It wouldn't be far fetched to assume that Hive is the only one alive who has any idea of the Inhumans origins other than that they're part alien.

Traders and Barbarians work only so-so with it, and I have not tried Caravans and Barbarian Attack with Cities and Knights together.\n",

They're also prone to eye and skin problems. If you \"don't have a lot of money\" but you have your heart set on getting a pet, a sphynx is just a really poor fit for you. Reputable breeders will not even sell to you if you do not have a strong enough income to properly care for the animal in the highly likely event that the cat has health issues.

            "A few things about your replay: one thing I noticed right away was that you have no Knock Off user, assuming you're using the sets listed in the original comment.  Knock Off is the best move in the metagame (I almost always run two mon with Knock Off on my teams) and is particularly important to sweepers like Fletch and Zig, who greatly appreciate opposing Eviolites and Berry Juices removed.  I would highly recommend Knock Off over Shell Smash on Dwebble (again, assuming you're using the above set) since you're using Dwebble to support another mon's sweep, rather that trying to sweep with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Itemless Fletchling hates switching into attacks, especially if you're not running Roost.  If you find that you generally use Fletchling as a lure (with Overheat), scout/pivot (with U-Turn), or a means to weaken stuff for Zigzagoon later, you might actually want to consider Berry Juice to give the burd some staying power.  Since itemless is usually a much better option for Fletch, you should do some experimenting to see if you need Fletch to switch into attacks and/or Stealth Rock frequently before making the change.  If you want to keep Acrobatics at 110 base power from the get-go, you could replace Swords Dance with Roost, since Zig will presumably be doing the boosting later.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I recommend dropping Porygon and adding fast pivot Mienfoo (EV spread in the original comment).  This thing makes almost any team better, without exaggeration.  Regenerator and Drain Punch means it can stick around for the whole match while repeatedly switching in to check threats.  It can switch in on Knock Offs (Porygon absolutely cannot, and Snubble needs its Berry Juice), and almost nothing wants to come in on Foo's Knock Off, since most of Foo's switch-ins usually need their Eviolite or Berry Juice to check other threats.  U-Turn is the last manditory move on this set, pairing with Regenerator to pivot at will.  Fourth move is totally customizable; Taunt shuts down slower hazard leads and, if you predict the switch-in, stops Foongus (Spore), Snubble (T-Wave), and Cottonee (lots of status moves, including Memento) from statusing whatever you switch to next.  Acrobatics can be very useful, since Mienfoo will often be taking Knock Offs; use this move if you have trouble dealing with opposing Mienfoo.  Fake Out is especially useful against Sash Abras that sacrifice Protect for a 4th coverage move.  Stone Edge surprises Flying types.  Finally, Poison Jab is highly situational, but it can work if you really struggle with Fairies.  I think your team could really benefit from Mienfoo's incredible utility of being able to do so many things with one set - staying alive through most of the match, Knocking Off items on mon that stand in your sweepers' way, U-Turning against switches to bring one of your frail mon in safely, the freedom to run whichever 4th move your team needs, and the added benefit of bringing Fighting typing (which is really good in LC) to your team.\n",

The problem is that the personalities of the hierarchy in the Church don't allow for contradiction, or paradox, irony, whatever you want to call it, and strongly discourage it with their micro-managed correlation.  They think that it helps the Church be \"pure\", but in reality, it only makes them look like dictators (to those who actually know how to think), and makes them look like revered idols (to those who are still indoctrinated and can't think).

My GF of 11 years and I recently broke up after a long chain of events, and are still living together in different bedrooms in our apartment, and I need real help and advice to move forward.  Its not that I want you all to do the heavy lifting, but I need some help in direction.\n",

            "Backstory: we are in our early 30’s, and have been together for 11 years.  Our relationship has always been unique and special in the way that I am an extrovert, and she is introvert.  Before we got together, I was in a couple of 1 to 2 year relationships, whereas she had only a couple of very short ones.  We fell deeply in love, and quickly started living together.  Our physical attraction to each other was intense at first, and we made love constantly.  Our level of trust with each other grew and we became a cohesive unit, we became everything to each other.  We had a large group of friends, 98% hers from college, who we socialized frequently with.\n",
            "\t\n",
            "Like all relationships, our honeymoon phase ended, with our level of physical intimacy declining over time.  This mostly started due to a quick phase of physical issues with me, as I am a type I diabetic and was in poor control of my health in my early 20’s.  My GF was amazing, and insisted that I take better care of myself, as she would not spend her life with someone who would not.  I got better, but the scars of my own insecurities remained, and I had issues with initiating sex, as I was scared she would reject me.  This pattern of behavior has plagued our relationship ever since, but as she has explained to me now; she was willing to make the compromise to be in sometimes-sexless relationship, as she loved me.  \n",
            "\t\n",
            "Our relationship operated under that guise for a long time.  Major life events happened, I lost my mother to cancer, a time where my GF was there for me every day.  We moved to a different part of the country for two reasons, her family lived there and my career was not going well and a transfer within the same company was a chance to stay afloat.  After moving, I sought out therapy as I had completely stopped feeling emotions or discussing them with her.  Once again, this was a change that she had to push me into. Not because she is bossy and pushy, but because I am always unwilling to make the necessary changes in my life.  It was helpful, but temporary, and I quickly moved on. Things were better, but not fixed. \n",

It took my GF basically picking a new life path for me, to go back to school and get a degree in the medical field.  Once again, she did this not as a nag, but because I was floundering and needed direction.  This is the pattern.  I am faced with a situation that requires me to take action, and I fail every time because I just say, “I don’t know what to do, BUT I REALLY want to change!”  It leads to failure every time.\n",

I’ve always been overweight, but generally healthy (good BP,HR, Cholesterol, A1C glucose) and I began to loose weight.  At around the same time is where the real issues started that has left me where I am today.  I began to seek out attention from a younger group subset of our long time group of friends.  I crafted this persona, and really dove into it with gusto, of being a young party person, who wanted to stay up all night drinking, texting and chatting constantly with a few people who were much younger than me.  I know that Age Aint Nuthin But A Number, but it was a lot of energy to focus on a group of people who’s biggest priority is getting fucked up all night and not working.  \n",

Essentially, she made another in a long string of compromises to maintain our relationship.  Well, the attention I put on this group escalated and became focused on one person in particular, and became inappropriate.  My GF is a highly perceptive person, and was not oblivious to what was happening.  She spent a lot of time attempting to dialogue with me about what was happening, but I was unwilling and unable to articulate it, as per usual, I would state that I did not why I was acting that way.\n",

I made promises, as I always had in the past, and made a minimal amount of effort, but in the end, did nothing.  I was away for most of April at training for a new job and through a series of phone conversations, where I was honest about everything that had happened, we broke up.  My attention on others and where I took that was bad, but what was worse, what really put us where we are, was my lack of action and the lack of care that shows her.  She wants to know why I so actively pursued the destruction of our relationship, with the belief that I must have wanted out, but was unwilling to do the work myself and attempted to force her to break up with me.\n",

While it would seem easier to just go our separate ways, we have loved each other for so long, and neither of us ever planned on being single again.  I want more than anything to work it out.

I’ve already made some mistakes in regards to this, as I had a drink with a woman who I met a year ago at a wedding, who is similar in character to the person I focused all the attention on mentioned above.  I put myself in that situation, as I wanted to see how I would handle it, whether I would act as I had before or if I could be mature about it.  I was mature, and spent the entire time talking about my GF.  When my GF asked me who I had been interacting with, I told her, and she was hurt.  She asked me to empathize and look at the situation from her point of view, and I could instantly see that I fucked up.     \n",

Given my affinity for combat flight sims its made me think about the reality for my Grandfather and the bomber crews in these eras. They were flying at 20-30,000ft in an unpressurized cabin, and in many ways were sitting ducks for Axis fighters to shoot at. Even more insane is that he joined up at 19 years of age. So to tie it all in with flight sims, anybody know of a combat sim that allows you to fly a B-24? Last I knew the only recently updated one was Warbirds which I'm not terribly fond of.

I am currently eating a high protein (~180-200g), low carb (under 30g/day) and low fat (30-50g). My question is: will the low fat part of my diet inhibit weight loss at all?

It won't penetrate guardians' shields, brutes' plating and thin cover with this, however it brings with it more pure damage, especially if there are biotics nearby, which is why i believe it's much better than any other ammo (even incendiary!) for biotic-heavy teams (and when used on any kind of non-warp non-reave biotic DoT character, of course - said powers being exception because of incendiary ammo bug which makes incendiary a better choice);\n",

            "\n",
            "You better believe it! I've seen very great players in Platinum doing exceptionally well with exactly the \"normal\", \"gold\" 1-shot Widow. And i know why. It's not too complex, but takes some space to explain... But, first there was even simpler consideration: by the time any relatively new player gets Widow X, most URs are at level 1...3, and will remain so for rather long while. Now if you'd do to the great table you linked and if you'd check \"multi-clip reload-cancel DPS\" of Widow X vs Ur sniper rifles at levels 1...3 - you will see that Widow is already way ahead. But back to why Widow really rocks, now! See, the Widow has native piercing in it, for 1 meter. And \"Native\" piercing means that there will NOT be any damage penalty when it hits something \"behind\" a wall / plating / shield / cover. It will do full 100% of its damage. This where that \"most\" word actually comes from: very few URs have similar ability, namely Javelin and Black Widow, though with the latter, its native penetration is reduced to 0.25 meters thick things only, i.e. 4 times less full-damage penetration distance than the Widow. \"Most\" other URs, sniper rifles and other types, - don't have this. And thus they are prone to that \"30% less damage\" and \"40% less damage\" you can see on all sorts of armor-piercing weapon mods. As for armor-piercing ammo - yes, that comes without such a damage penalty, but Warp ammo has higher damage bonus in it even without any biotic ability affecting your target, and MUCH higher while there is some biotic thing on your target. This is how that 1-meter \"native\" Widow penetration ends up being rather special factor allowing to get more punch than \"simple\" DPS numbers \"on paper\". Oh, and also, native penetration does not prevent any _additional_ penetration from being effective, - when combined, it works in most perfect way, afaik: 1st meter of \"solid thing\", Widow will pierce with its \"native\" penetration, hitting anything \"not dead yet\" for 100% of its damage, and then further \"within some solid thing\" distance the bullet will go through as well for the distance listed on whatever extra penetration source you used with the Widow, and in this part applying corresponding damage penalty. Means Widow penetrates 0.75 thicker objects than Black Widow would, everything else being the same, - and full 1 meter thicker objects than most other guns. Extra damage you get from that when you place your shots well is hard to quantify, but skilled player, knowing all this and with practice, will be able to do quite much more than \"pure numbers\" would suggest, you know? ;)\n",

            "\n",
            "About Striker: yes, yes, details. Use Turian, extra stability from gear, and use cover as much as humanly possible (shooting from cover, especially full \"standing up\" cover, improves stability much). Extra ammo in the clip is pretty much mandatory, yep. Personally, i do all that when i get my Striker for a run or few. It's all very much assumed to be considered and used as a part of \"proper\" kit setup, you know. :)\n",

Ergo, what else can do in \"sniper rifle\" department as well as CSR can do, if for any reason the player is not happy going Widow (nor any other \"signle shot\" rifle)? Quite a few classes have specific +sniper_rifle damage bonuses, you know. Plus the CSR has unlimited ammo. Plus it has IMHO excellent balance between damage per shot and rate of fire - very flexible, allowing you to do sheer DPS, or just finish nearly-dead enemies, and mix both kinds, without spending extra damage to \"overkill\" any much, and with great rate of fire. Thus for quite many players and some play styles / kits, it's indeed the best gun (until high-level URs, that is), me thinks. \n",

This is distinct from a pot still, where you fill it up with a charge, seal it, run it until it is done, then stop, empty, clean and repeat.  You may have a \"batch\" in a column still, in that the wash isn't flowing into the still 24x7, but it is still a continuous operation while it is running.  \n",

The defining characteristic of a pot still is where the charge goes in, and the fact that it is a batch process.\n",

His ultimate is an incredibly well-designed stealth, because it gives you an indication of where he went. It's not a blink, it just gives him an opportunity to close/run. Its cooldown is short enough to make it viable in teamfights, but long enough so that you can't abuse it to escape from ganks. It does enough damage to be worth it, but it can also be used as an initiate or escape. It's damage and utility, but it also showcases their skill v. your skill. In addition, what makes him strong isn't his abilities or farming, it's his synergy. The fact that his abilities are synergistic but he still gives the opportunity to counter him is very, very fun in a mid-laner. He's not very good top, he can be okay bottom, but like a lot of AP mids, he tends to scale off a bit.

In between them lies another sub-gradient, the souls of the original two, Anui-El and Sithis. As per usual, these two serve as direct opposites, these being everything and nothing. Sithis is nothing itself, the infinite emptiness too absurd for our perceptions. Within Sithis is nothing, but we, as mere mortals, cannot comprehend true nothing. We are too far removed from Sithis to understand, I believe the Ada can understand it, but not us. Try and imagine nothing. What do you see? An infinite blackness, I assume. But that is nothing, it is still an image of blackness. You cannot imagine nothing, our minds are too simple. Sithis, as we've said, cannot be directly perceived, but the result of it can. Some claim that Sithis was the first, which is a believable idea, for what can come before everything but nothing? And the only thing that can come before nothing is nothing. Nothing gave way for everything, where stasis and change could fuel time and space, and all of the Aurbis could function.

So if Sithis is absolute nothingness, then essentially the Dark Brotherhood worships nothing. This is where it gets hazy to me. I can understand the Brotherhood worshiping their Night Mother, possibly worshiping a Daedra such as Nocturnal, or just operating on their own, but are they just oblivious? Do *they* think that Sithis is a higher being?

They think of him as their Dread Father who married the Night Mother, and they are the metaphorical children of that union.

Someone has to process the raw so most people do it in camera and let the camera settings decide how much saturation to apply, how aggressive to be with lifting the shadows, white balance, etc. but if you do it in raw, you get to decide that stuff later while looking at it in a big monitor with far more precise tools at your disposal.  \n",

Between the First Person Shooters, The MMOs, and the unending stream of overblown mobile games, it is easy to think that the best of gaming is far behind us. But this is different. It's more than just a frenzy of button presses or quick reactions. It's the art form that we all love, demonstrated in some of the purest ways it may ever be.

With games like Dragon Age Inquisition, The Order 1886, Watch Dogs, and Bioshock Infinite to name a few, It seems nothing ever lives up to what i want it to be. But this blew me away. I made this post yesterday after getting my platinum trophy. I spent way more time getting my plat than most people cause i kept restarting to try new character builds and i loved going through the game so i was in no hurry. I'm playing it right now even and I'm still having fun. I had recently gotten to the point where I played games just cause thats all I really do. I hardly ever really loved a game, but since i picked Dark Souls 2 last April, From Soft as reinvigorated my love for video Games. I really owe it all to that amazing company.\n",

Not just the mechanics, but the story is so good and universal they can't make another main story; they can only add lore.This is why I think a sequel won't come out. I sure wish for at least 2 DLC's though.\n",

Furthermore, they can't change these great mechanics and there are few possible weapons to add. It's just to hard to create enough content for a sequel, but enough to make a DLC\n",

Same thing happened with dark souls 1 too. I eventually made it to blight town after at least a year of on off playing and eventually gave up. Then when I got to Dark Souls 2, my gaming skills had matured enough and I gave it another shot. With some help in learning the mechanics, I eventually learnt the way to play and then made my way through the game. Once I completed the game, it was safe to say that it was one of the best experiences I have ever had playing a video game of this generation. I can still remember my struggle through each of the levels and bosses of the game like it was yesterday. Any other game, I barely remember anything, because nothing stands out at me enough to grab my attention. Then I went back and played Dark Souls 1, and it became one of my favourite games of all time. I simply enjoyed it too much (including the DLC).\n",

See, there's no problem with showing a Korra who goes after Mako like a bee to honey in Season 1, although there is nothing to suggest a stable relationship will come out of it.

We had a rocky few months a while back that led to us breaking up, but we have gotten back together and tried to fix our issues and I think we have come a long way. This isn’t necessarily relevant to the question I’m asking, but I’m just providing it by way of background.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alex is an extrovert and he has a large, really active group of friends. They’re nice people. They really like to party, but they’re loyal and good to one another. They’re just kind of closed off––they’re never rude to outsiders, but like any group of friends they have a lot of inside jokes, have been travelling together, have their own dynamic, etc. I’m an introvert, and I have a smaller group of friends. Around my friends, I’m known as the funny, sarcastic one; I'm not socially awkward and I feel confident and comfortable. While Alex occasionally asks me to tag along to group activities our groups of friends are really separate, and have been since we started dating. For some reason, I just get extremely socially awkward when I’m around them and I can’t explain why. I’m nervous, my jokes come out wrong, I seem standoffish and rude. They’re nice to me but I sometimes feel awkward because they’re such a close group. \n",
            "\n",
            "Alex also is quite independent and when we go out in groups he’s not glued to my side or anything; oftentimes he’ll spend the whole night chatting up various friends. I’m fine with this, but I sometimes feel this makes me act even more awkwardly. We’re in college now, and back in high school I was 20 pounds overweight, didn’t take care of myself, was fiercely standoffish, and never really ‘got’ how to be social. I’ve since overcome most of that, and I’m much more secure in myself now. But Alex’s friends remind me of the sort of people who would ignore me in high school; even though they really are very nice to me, I think I regress some when I spend time with them and become that socially awkward teenager again. I think this is exacerbated by the fact that his friends are a mixed group of mostly attractive girls (he didn’t choose them like this, they all basically lived in the same dorm freshman year). It makes me really dislike spending time with Alex when he’s around his friends, since he seems so at ease and so included and I’m not. I don’t expect to be part of their group, but I just wish I didn’t feel so painfully different. I do wish he acknowledged me more in the group or was more affectionate to me around other people, but that’s just not him.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don’t spend a lot of time with Alex’s friends, but I need to figure out how to stop seeming so bitchy. It just seems like we all don’t vibe on the same wavelength. They’re really nice to me, but I still am an outsider, and I don’t know how to get comfortable. Over the summer I easily integrated into my older brother Joe’s group of friends and got really comfortable around them even though they were strangers, I just can’t figure out why I can’t do this with Alex even after two years. I get hyper-aware of everything I say around them and my body movements, which makes me seem even weirder and more unnatural.\n",

Dunno if that's a thing...) that get paired up together, having the players duke it out in a free-for-all pvp match at the end of the dungeon to see who gets away with the artifact or story prize at the end?\n",

Or engage in constitution-based drinking contests?

I think that allowing players to at least assist or influence the content by means of crowdsourcing would be incredible.  The only other option I see making this idea fitting (which I love this idea, this is why I play D&D sometimes still) is allowing a rulebook or sorts and a mission generator or mission editor in this game where players can make their own missions within the world, as long as it follows the rules and parameters to stick with the game.

            "I'd like to see something along those lines, even though it's more of an active combat system, and the teams seem to be more random; the ability to see an assassin lay a poison gas trap, for instance, and have a wizard lay some fire to it- causing an explosive blast in an area possibly a little smaller than the initial area the gas may have covered, add a burn DoT to the poison DoT.... that sort of thing would take a lot ofthe hack and slash feel out of what we observed from the combat system, and make it much more possible to develop some real strategies on the fly.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm flip-flopping on the instanced social hub thing. Experienced it in Guild Wars, and it kinda felt a little like a waste of time, having to bounce from town to town to find certain vendors, craftsmen, or party members. Now, a compromise would be cool. An advertising board at the school, or a website,  or something along those lines - where people could see global chat, missions/quests, maybe even requests for specific classes in pre-built parties, seems like it would satisfy most of my needs....\n",
            "14898 elaboration answer Yeah DA:O had an amazing combat system.. as long as they stay far, far, FAR away from the monstrous abomination that was DA2. But synergistic magic/abilities and such is always a joy to see, particularly if done well. I do hope we'll see some of that make it into SR. \n",
            "\n",
            "As far as the social hub, I know exactly what you mean. I've seen it done really badly. Guild Wars, Vindictus, Path of Exile.. it really depends on the game, and how they pull it off. I think it -can- be excellent if done well, but it's hit or miss on whether they can pull it off. \n",
            "\n",
            "In some ways, it ends up just feeling.. fake. You -only- see groups of people in a hub, and then you're out in the world alone with your group. It's a very bizarre feeling. Of course, they're not going for an MMORPG, which might mitigate that some. It's one thing when you're expecting an MMORPG, and you get a social hub with zones. It's another when you go in expecting a 4v1 situation, where at -best- you'll have a social hub to see other players, and more likely you'll have a lobby like Diablo. *shrug* \n",
            "14901 elaboration answer I apologize, I misunderstood. Here's my suggestion- general chat window in the hubs (like Diablo 3), but instanced hub worlds that you can invite your friends to. \n",
            "\n",
            "Obviously we don't know much at all what this hub looks like but I like the idea of it being a kind of \"player housing\" that we can invite our friends to. This prevents the hub being just swarmed but allows us to talk to other players in between missions as well. \n",
            "\n",
            "The thing is, with this being firmly not an MMO, how many MMO features do we expect to see in it? I think the \"instanced hub\" idea could be a good in between, allowing us to have a social aspect of the game without wasting valuable dev time and effort on it.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, I think we're going to see the \"in between\" areas as brief single player areas where we talk to a few NPCs and get some back story before jumping back into the fray. This is an action RPG, and I suspect we'll see it play exactly like that, with little downtime.\n",
            "14902 elaboration answer Destiny, Vindictus, and Dragon's Nest all did a phenomenal job with integrating Social Hubs into their Dungeon Crawl type game experience. This has been done before, and I'd imagine a company like BioWare can do it again.\n",
            "14903 agreement answer I completely agree it could be done. It really depends on how they want to handle it. Something that occurs to me is the idea of a persistent character - which it sounds like ShRealms will offer - what about the people who play SHLords? Do they hang out in the same socia hub? If not, then you get 2 hubs and one is 4x as populated as the other, if it's not instanced. If they do, then you have a bunch of enemies hanging out together, which is immersion and fourth wall breaking.\n",
            "14904 elaboration question The developers have stated that every player will create a Hero and a Shadow Lord. They didn't go into detail about how the two were connected, but every player will have a Hero Archetype Character - so playing in a Social Hub wouldn't be exclusive to Hero types.\n",
            "14905 elaboration answer \n",
            "14906 elaboration answer That's a valid point, but I suppose the key is how the two relate if at all. If they are simply two separate characters then people who main a SHLord will feel left out in the social hub if the have to represent themselves using their hero character. Again keeping in mind it would be immersion/lore damaging to have them all just hanging out in one area. Also a SHLord only area would be visually incredibly boring as even if SHLords get gear they would all look very similar. \n",
            "\n",
            "Don't get me wrong, I still like the social hub idea, I really do. I'm just playing devil's advocate here because I think there are a number of hindrances to a social hub system making sense. You don't expect a hub zone in Call of Duty between maps, just the lobby; I think the online multiplayer in Shadow Realms, while still featuring rpg elements,  will be closer in execution to something like CoD than to an mmo; what you're describing is still a predominantly mmo feature, and SHRealms isn't an mmo.\n",
            "14907 elaboration question Yeah - I hear ya. I apologize for the shortness of my replies. I've been putting together some video commentary describing the game on my YouTube channel. I love these discussions, but don't always have time to post full thoughts.\n",

            "Online games, particularly RPGs, require good social networking. If you're an old school gamer like me, you'd remember the days of Battle.Net - A system of chat rooms where RPG gamers could meet, join clans, and form parties before going off into the actual game itself. This goes to show that before the technology became available for actual in-game social hubs, there was a true/real desire for Social Interaction. Heck, I remember holding Diablo 1 Clan meetings over Battle.net (I was kiddie back then, lol).\n",
            "\n",
            "Long story short - it doesn't matter how they handle the Social Hub. It needs to be handled in a way where players can just hang out with their avatars with other players. This technology exists and is readily available. I'm sure they can implement this using some of the same environments they are already creating.\n",
            "14908 elaboration answer I don't mind rogues role playing their characters but I do have to admit it needs the right group. Some people are fine with it, even enjoy the attempt to bring personality to the character.. But many hate it, and just consider it selfish. It has to done with people of a similar mindset.\n",
            "14909 elaboration answer Well, as I said, loot's probably a bad place to implement this since people get really touchy about it (like your comment), but rivalry between party members is just as important in a D&D campaign as rivalry with the DM.  Even if it's just a small reward for whoever killed the most monsters.\n",
            "\n",
            "A case in point: I was playing through SWTOR with a friend a little while back.  My friend was playing a bounty hunter and had aboslutely the worst luck on dialogue rolls that involved negotiating money.  I'd win those roles 9/10 times and it was hilarious hearing him curse about it on Vent.  It didn't ruin gameplay rewards, but it did add some great value into the overall experience.\n",
            "14910 disagreement answer ... for you. Maybe your friend didn't feel the same? It's easier to laugh it off when you're not the one having the rotten luck and being screwed by the game for no reason at all.\n",

            "14911 elaboration answer That's true but it can be awfully frustrating in those situations when your character doesn't get a say at all in the dialogue. If you keep losing dialogue rolls, it feels like your character isn't involved much in the story. But that isn't going to be the situation for SR. I don't think there will be much dialogue in the missions themselves.\n",
            "14913 elaboration answer That's only a problem if the loot isn't instanced; TESO does this, as does Guild Wars 2 and any number of other games, Borderlands 2 comes to mind- loot feels like you're working to get it, and you are, but it benefits the entire party and there's no fighting between players when everyone gets equal loot.\n",

A lot of Xin Zhao players like to start with Q, but W gives you immediate health regeneration on every third hit, which is better if you're jungling without a leash. You'll get a bit low, but you won't need to use a health pot. The Bottom River Crab is worth trying to secure for three reasons. First, it gives you health and mana back if you kill it, as well as some vision for your team. Second, even if you don't kill it, you'll still get health back (W passive). Third, by the time you're finished, or if you want to abandon it because the other team sees you, your smite will be back up in time for the Red Buff, which will give you health back upon smiting. When you get to level 30 and have a full set of runes and masteries, though, you can abandon this and do a regular Buff->Wolves->Buff route. If you're not as healthy as you'd like after Blue Buff, you can try to get the Top River Crab.

It's your call. Now, Gragas doesn't technically life steal off the Bottom River Crab, but he does get 4% health back on ability use once every 8 seconds with his passive, so the brief diversion to the Bottom River Crab can give him back between 8% and 12% of his health before taking on Red Buff.

Because of this, getting the Bottom River Crab is strongly recommended if you want to be able to gank at level 3. Please note, however, that Pantheon is a very strong duelist in the early game, and so you should be able to secure that crab from anybody who shows up. If you fail to get the crab, it's not the end of the world, just go get Red Buff, go clear Wolves (they do less damage than Blue Buff), and then go back to base and heal up, buying the smite upgrade. However, if you do everything in this order, including getting both Crabs, then you're in a great position to gank.

If you can do this, though, you should be able to finish up the above route and be at around 70% health, which with all three abilities isn't half bad for ganking (not as good as when you've got your ult, but still not bad). Whacking away at the crab increases your fury, which you can cash in with your Q in order to gain health, so it's worthwhile to at least try to get that crab if you can.

As already established, Alex's fist abilities are very diverse and very good. In Round 1 I forgot to mention the body surf, which is an incredible attack, especially when you realize Alex can also launch Heller away from him once he hits him (with Flipkick Launcher). Afterwards, he can grab an object and throw it at Heller, who is now really far away from Alex. It makes for a deadly sequence of events seeing as many of Alex's unarmed attacks can knock Heller away, giving him free time to throw cars or whatnot at Heller. I'd also like to remind people that Cannonball is a thing, which one-shots helicopters in Prototype 1 if you have Musclemass on.\n",

I'll assume Alex will respond to tendrils the same way that the Evolved do in Prototype 2, although I will assume that Alex will get webbed up by the tendrils if Heller hits him cleanly (this is not the case with the Evolved). Alex has the range with Palm Slam to zone out Heller to a certain extent. Palm Slam's range is roughly that of a standard tendril attack. The meat of Tendril's danger is from the Black Hole attack. It has massive range and will deal with Alex pushing Heller away reasonably well. As such, Alex being able to throw things isn't entirely free. \n",

From Heller's perspective, his job is to stay close to Mercer and use Black Hole if he gets too far away from Alex.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'd say this is either a **5/10 or 6/10 for Mercer**, not sure which. Alex has his air kick imto Body Surf into Flipkick Launcher into throwing stuff which is really good, but Heller could could perhaps catch that with a raw tendril or Black Hole. In any case, it's close.\n",

            "\n",
            "Alright this round is the real match. Right off the bat, there's some very important things to keep in mind. Alex can now use Blade, which is probably his best power. It deals very high damage, especially his aerial attack. His heavy attack is three very quick slices that deal good damage and can be very useful if Heller ever slips up. \n",
            "\n",
            "Most notably though, Alex has his Armor. I've tested it in game and I'd say that Armor reduces Alex's damage taken by about 50%. This means that many of Heller's light attacks will be a lot less effective. Heller will have to resort to his big guns to deal any significant damage to Mercer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Heller on he other hand also gets a really powerful defensive tool: his Shields. Heller can use this to counter Mercer's blows quite reliably. I will slightly nerf the Shields for this fight though, as in-game, you could pretty much use the shield counter all day and stomp any boss or high level enemy, including the in-game Mercer fight. I'll make it so that Heller does have to put some thouts into his counters and can be punished for it if it misses. If I didn't include this nerf, this fight would easily go to Heller because shield counter is OP.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another thing tomkeep in mind is that Heller now has Bio-bombs, which are legit powerful. Heller can grab any infected from the Red Zone, bio-bomb 'em and throw them at Alex. This will do a lotmof damage against him, so he'll have to be very careful with the infected in the neighborhood. A response to Heller doing Bio-bombs is for Alex to quickly take a corner and consume some infected to regain his health. If Heller notices Alex doing that, he himself will consume some dudes as well. For this reason, I think Heller will only try one attempt at bio-bombing Alex, after which he'll immediately give chase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, we have the Devastators and Pack Leader. Alex's devastators themselves are far superior to the one that Heller has, most notably his Tendril Blast thingy, where he shoots a ton of tendrils from his hands right at the opponent. This is Alex's most powerful attack and it does INSANE amounts of damage. If Heller ever gets hit hy it, he'll likely lose like half his health. Alex also has Tendril Barrage as a fantastic AoE move that also does good damage. I don't think Alex will use Groundspike Graveyard, as it can be easily avoided by Heller and punished with something like his Hammerfist air heavy, dealing a lot of damage to Alex.\n",
            "\n",
            "Heller's devastator is something he won't be using. It doesn't do enough damage to make it worth it, especially when Alex has armor on. No, he'll be using his Pack Leader. This summons several (let's say 3) pretty powerful Brawlers for James to send at Alex. This'll provide a powerful distraction, while Heller can use his Whipfist or Tendrils to attack from long range, while Alex is busy with the Brawlers.\n",
            "\n",
            "All things taken together, I'm surprised that Heller can actually put up a good fight against Mercer. He has the strength to back it up and abilities to match. However... Alex has armor. Armor is incredible for Alex's survivability, allowing him to tank a lot more hits than Heller may be prepared for. It hits his mobility sure, but if Heller decides to flee, Mercer can switch out his Armor for his own Shield, while still having good mobility.\n",
            "\n",
            "So round 6, I'm gonna have to say **Alex Mercer 7/10.** I totally expected it to be like 9/10 Alex beforehand, but after playing a bunch of Prototype 2, Heller's powers are a lot more powerful than I remembered. Pack Leader and Shields are a massive help for dealing with Alex. However, Armor is just too damn powerful. It makes many of Heller's attacks pointless because they just won't do enough damage. Heller can take 3/10 if he uses Pack Leader optimally and Mercer doesn't learn how to deal with Shields. However, Mercer is not dumb either and has plenty of ways to get Heller away from him.\n",

            "15797 elaboration answer Sounds to me as if you don't understand component level mechanics. This isn't how RAM is used, even IF leveraged by software. ECC, and Non-ECC RAM will page off any data not physically being accessed or cached by higher level functions. While BDO does leverage caching over paging relatively more than any other game (thus lack of loading screens) it can NOT simple dynamically allocate caching based upon availability. This is managed by the OS. Not the component nor the software. The OS will access more RAM as paging requires, and only then. If that was not the case then hard-limits would have to exist on all software, indexing, services, PIDS, and OS level interactions otherwise they will cut out the middle man, over-allocate and cause system instability (resulting in a BSOD) Which they can not. That middle man the OS communicates with the enumerated API's and allocates dynamically needed memory, and then releases via paging operations back to the HDD/SDD for read/write operations. Furthermore excessive amounts of data cached onto RAM increases probability of hard-faulting, and excessive paging also known as the infamous \"Memory-Leak\". This is why from an SQA perspective allowing anything to access more RAM than is needed has catastrophic effects on performance (Better to page it back for read/write, then re-query the data from storage for a fresh digital handshake). Memory Leaks are usually a result of the OS being queried for data from the RAM or Page operation, and the OS is unable to locate the physical location of the data, thus it re-allocates a duplicate set of data to the RAM again. This can occur many-times over up to the point of hitting all available RAM pooling. Memory leaks are not always caused by the requesting software (in this case BDO) - It can be caused by the OS, GPU, RAM, Software, Driver, Controller, I/O differential, PIDS, BG Services, ect. The best thing i'd recommend is open task manager > Go to performance > Reasource monitor > RAM > Sort by hard faults > observe the PID fault rate. If BDO is faulting over 50 faults, check all PID's if multiple are faulting AT ALL (Anything above 0) then you know it's not BDO, you have some sort of intermedium issue. If only BDO is faulting, i would reinstall (Clean, uninstall, run CCleaner, reinstall) - Or go 1 step further, create a new VHD, or partition and only install BDO on that partition. If the problem persists, start removing RAM sticks, and observe til you locate the bad boy. If all RAM sticks are causing the issue, then i'd wage a bad I/O controller. \n",

But that doesn't make it not a poor decision on its own. Hindsight isn't a valid calculation factor either. And it's pretty obvious you're just arbitrarily sticking with your own personal decisions because they're yours. I guarantee if something happened to your job and you were forced to, you could find just as good job opportunities in cities that don't have such upside down real estate markets.

That's one reason why I have a problem with when to build the larger buildings--there's only so much stone to be had, and I have never once, in any game I've tried, been visited by a trader with stone.  I just can't imagine how people manage it. \n",

Open the orders tab and if there is a stone button, select it, make sure you also set the order to every visit, next time that trader comes along he should have some stone\n",
            "16117 answer elaboration I figured out what I was doing wrong two days ago. I, like you, was falling apart at a specific point. Mine was more around 100-150 before everything went wrong. Hopefully this advice will be helpful for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first thing I figured out was that I was trying to expand too much when I was expanding. I made 6-7 towns that all did the same thing. 100-150 people, then starvation or freezing would hit. I wasn't able to provide for how much I was expanding. I would build houses, and the people would reproduce. I would end up with more children than I could handle. Since children don't do anything, you don't want to have too many of them, other wise the adults won't be able to provide for them. Once the first starving/freezing citizen hit, I panicked, because I knew what was coming. However, I did the wrong thing and made it worse. I thought, \"Oh no, the people need food, I need to make more ___\", which makes sense in one way, but it doesn't in another. It hit me after 7 tries; if I can't provide for what I have, why am I expanding to try and fix it? Take it slow, and don't rush expansion. Build up what you need before you decide to expand also. This includes builders and laborers for the jobs you want to be done at this part of town initially).\n",
            "\n",
            "As far as actually expanding beyond the \"town center\", I normally do this:\n",
            "1. Build a road to the designated spot.\n",
            "2. Build stock pile.\n",
            "3. Build a few homes (2-3) at the spot (for the builders). Be mindful if you have a market of where you place them.\n",
            "4. Build some of what you want there. For instance, if you want farms, build farms. Etc.\n",

            "For that point on, it is supply and demand scenario. \n",
            "\n",
            "I tend to build the trading post when I feel comfortable with what I have. I tend to build a Town Hall to monitor the produced/used ratio of my goods. Once I feel that I am taking in enough food and firewood to maintain the town, I normally build my trading post. When I do, I normally stop expanding for a bit to build up my supplies.\n",
            "\n",
            "As far as stone house, I have a city with 550 people in it and I only have 6-8 stone homes. I don't think the positives of it outweigh the cost of supplies (a stone home uses more wood than a wood home, too). If you wish to use a lot of stone, quarries are meh with uneducated workers. If your workers are educated and you have 15 people working it, it can bring in a decent amount of stone. But you need to be well enough with food and wood to be able to sacrifice 15 people to do it. Otherwise, I tend to have just a few people working it. Same goes with the mine, vendors, or traders where I sometimes only have 1-2 people working it if I need help elsewhere.\n",
            "16119 answer question My thought process is as follows:\n",

I just started a game this morning, and once I had enough population I had laborers clear the land and place all the resources for the market and my first trading post, then I paused them.  I think that might be a good solution for my previous problem.\n",

The second one, yes, the early Chilean Navy's commander were mostly British, but I believe those were individually recruited, not part of a formal support by the Royal Navy (see Lord Cochrane, who served in Chile only after being dismissed in England). The last one was simply an incident not a confrontation, and Chile was supporting GB anyway, so I doubt anyone (other than Argentina) made a big deal about it.\n",

Unfortunately, Lab is extremely influenced by *RNG* mob spawns, so even the best laid plan may sometimes not be enough in the face of the mighty **RNGesus**.

Falcon's invuln is critical to avoiding particularly nasty attacks, and his 100% normal attack boost never hurts. Blackaria's there because her death passive grants 8 seconds of invulnerability that *cannot be removed*. While Falcon's invuln can be buff-wiped, BA's is different as it persists for the entire 8 seconds, giving you a short while to not worry about a failed lab run.\n",
            "\n",
            "The last ally spot can go to whomever you prefer, but my ideal candidate is **Shaman Doll Margaret**, because she can summon empowered deities ever so often, and still is able to pack an AoE punch with her first skill, and her second passive. Most importantly, however, is the stun that she inflicts while using her third skill to bring out a summon. A 10 second stun usually means you'll be safe for that round, and neutralizes a lot of threats.\n",

            "Since being shut out in back-to-back games at the end of March, New York has rebounded with a strong four-game stretch to re-establish itself in playoff position. The Rangers beat the Jets, took three of four points in a home-and-home with the Penguins and continued their three-game road trip with a 4-1 win in Carolina on Saturday. The final score is deceiving, as Lundqvist turned in a masterful 48-save performance, including 14 during a scoreless first period and 21 more in the third as the Hurricanes frantically tried to come back. Derek Stepan and Rick Nash scored power-play goals.\n",

This will help certain warframe such as Rhino and Zephyr tank more effectively and help weaker allies and less experienced players from being killed far too quickly.\n",

            "You may argue that \"Warframe is not WOW\" but this would give most of the warframes the potential to be more effective at what they do best, for example Vauban would be able to trap a greater number of enemies in more situations that simply spamming the life pod/terminals in defence missions, whilst Rhino, Mesa, Trinity, Zephyr, Valkyr and Frost could actually serve more effective tanking roles, helping the team to stay alive.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, this change could help to make Warframe more challenging for veteran players as they can play under the threat of being killed far more easily whilst allowing for greater crowd control synergy and more variety in loadouts, essentially becoming a short-term handicap that can turn into a massive advantage for a co-ordinated team. \n",

Instead of having mods to draw aggro, people just need to stick together so they don't get swarmed on the other side of the map. \n",
            "16738 agreement elaboration I agree that encouraging people to stick together is good, but I feel like it can be counter-intuitive to Warframe's speed-based gameplay to have the whole squad less than 20 meters or so apart. Also I find it strange that a stealth warframe is far more capable at drawing enemy fire than every tank in the game.\n",

Almost all high tier missions that I do are done with at least one person I know and am talking with, since we have a group of 9 people. Someone is almost always on. I know that most people don't have this, but because of this group teamwork is never really an issue.  \n",
            "16743 elaboration answer I constantly hang around T2-T4 of the void for 40 minute missions, however I just feel that the current system relies on a \"cheesy\" form of harder difficulties which is just to force you to keep the team's damage output insanely high through ultras like Exalibur's that don't require any form of skill or provide any challenge to use; it simply becomes uses glass cannon AOEs through walls without consequence.\n",
            "16744 elaboration answer The thing is, it's possible to avoid relying on those glass cannons and crazy damage output builds, but it is very difficult to pull off successfully.  The difficulty pretty much forces you to fall back on the same few abilities and the same few weapons (i.e. Radial javelin and the like) but there ARE other viable builds. However, no one uses them because they either take too much time to make and actually do take skill. Unfortunately, the easier way is the 'better' way. \n",

            "16753 elaboration answer I guess I come from a piano background, so the idea of melody first, rhythm and additions later probably starts from there.  I know I was frustrated when I started learning through rhythm only how few songs sounded like songs.  It's far easier for me to keep up playing if it sounded more and more like the song.  That being said, I had already a pretty good ability to understand complex note patterns and such from piano while keep time.  Who knows, that was my experience at least.  \n",
            "16754 elaboration answer Looking over your suggestion, I can see where it's the same: you suggest stripping out all the 'fluff' - just get the shell of the melody rather than try to force it into an arbitrary rhythmic pattern. Otherwise it's just confusing (as the OP discovered).\n",

I am always value betting if checked to on the river (ON A BLANK RIVER, flush coming in I check back, not because it scares me, but because it would scare him from betting KK/AA often enough that our value bet becomes too thin), it's very likely he has AT or JJ.\n",

The movement you got going is how we did it with one minor change, for the top totem only 1 pair should link it. Let's say the top-left paid goes for the top totem, this means the top right pair only needs to do the 1 totem in-between  the right and top totems only, avoiding 4 people running for the same totem! I would have your best surviving players on the top totem due to this. Make sure everyone runs to the middle once they are done linking their totems  and if you have any, get your hunters/warlocks to make their pet go to the centre once phase begins, if they are anywhere else they can chain to people who don't want to be hit by the lightning. And all ranged should stand as close to their position for linking as they can while still hitting the add. \n",

For example getting food and eating with bushcraft doesn't have to be a thing where one is losing weight and eating poorly. There are many anthropology books that explain genius and reproducible techniques that indigenous people used. Ten years ago, I thought things would collapse within a a few years. I've had more time to learn more things and am glad that I laid out a plan for what to learn in what order. Now I know most of the edible and medicinal plants in the area and how to use them creatively. I can hunt well. I fish, but not just with a rod and reel. I trap. I've got the different areas of food and medical stuff covered that I am moving onto woodworking and blacksmithing.

This all stopped when I found out that a girl I was dating was lying to me, cheating etc. and it really hurt me, but it fucked me up a lot more than I initially thought it did, it took time to come out of me through my actions. Last year I got out of a relationship with a girl I was seeing for years. This girl is beautiful, one of the kindest and most caring people I've ever met in my life, has a good head on her shoulders and what she wants to do with her life.. the type of girl that any sensible person who is lucky enough to date her would marry. It wasn't discovered until more recently, but she had libido issues due to depression, and that didn't work out for me, being that I'm a very sexual, affectionate person. I started seeing other women behind her back, because other than the lack of sex everything was great. In the end I finally brought myself to leave her because I couldn't keep doing that to her. She thinks I won't be with her because of things that we can 'fix' and wants to have another go at it, but I can't even be in a relationship with her again because of how terrible I was to her behind her back, I can't continue to face her and tell her I love her knowing that and having that guilt.\n",

From the start, I told this girl she wouldn't trust me after how we began seeing each other, because she knew about my relationship that I was still in. I finally start to be good to this girl, because despite the obvious reasons not to, I want to be good for this girl and I really want to be together. She'd been emotionally and physically abused in the past and I want to be a \"real\" man, and I want to be there for her and to take care of her. I want to bring her happiness that she'd deserved before but couldn't get, and still apparently can't get. This weekend I drunkenly (I don't recall details of the call, that's how drunk I was..) called a girl I used to see, obviously with bad intentions, and she found out. Nothing resulted from the call, but she found out and is obviously upset but she's wanting to stop seeing me due to everything that's happened in the past. I have real feelings for this girl, and after all this time together (though the beginning was twisted in nature), I think I love her, based on my understanding of the word and the sensation. I could ramble on about how I feel about her and all the happiness she brings me, but I won't... don't interpret this as immature feelings or underdeveloped or what have you.. we've known each other for years and I really care about this girl and think that I love her.\n",

When I see women out and about I size them up like many people do, but if I'd been drinking too much and am given the chance I might automatically get flirtatious with them and have intentions on sleeping with them. I don't know how to stop my mind from thinking like this, it's just how my mind operates and I hate it. I don't know why I can't stop myself from thinking like this or making bad decisions when I'm drunk, but it has to stop, it's not even what I consciously want and know I shouldn't be doing. I don't want to try to entertain other women or sleep with them for short-term gratification, I want to be a good man for this girl and give her what she deserves and I want to share real love and not have to hide a guilty conscience and deal with self-loathing as a result of my actions.\n",

            "18853 answer agreement Agree with prior comment.  You're saying things that sound really weird in a polyamory discussion group.  You feel guilty and terrible because you are not being honest and open about what you are doing and because society expects you to follow the rules guiding relationships.  Poly people don't feel guilty for having multiple relationships because they are open and up front about what's going on.  If you really want to be monogamous, you need to find out how to change your current behavior (see prior comment). If you want to be poly, you need to change your WHOLE way of thinking.  You seem to me like someone who may truly be poly at heart but because of societal expectations and lying and cheating has extreme guilt.  It doesn't have feel or be this way. What if that beautiful girl with depression really understood polyamory and agreed to it?  Learn more, talk to close friends and prior or current relationships about.  I know it's hard.  We are so trained to view multiple relationships as wrong that we never talk about the pink elephant.  Look at the statistics on cheating.  Wouldn't it be so much better if we could be open.  There's lots of people who can't do it because of jealousy and I don't think it is right for everyone but as hard as it is to talk about the rewards could be amazing. \n",

Both cars get the \"cool car tax\" but the dealer needs to get over themselves, theyre and Mustangs are dime a dozen. As for the 11, not a bad deal but dont over extend yourself.

I wasnt even strong enough to go to the gym and use the machines properly, for 2 months i did at home training, with various exercises. I have gone from being able to curl 10lbs to 25lbs, which isnt much but its progress, all of my other muscles have grown as well and Im happy with the direction im going. The problem is, my biggest insecurity is my arm size, when i wear a t-shirt i want my arms to occupy more space than they do, and I know that will come in time but are their exercises that will increase that size faster, or more efficiently?

It was a visually amazing movie, but we left a couple times to vape the weed and check out some other movies in other theatres. So that was Monday, on Wednesday my friend Moo and I decide it's about time we test out the 25c tabs we have lying around. The blotters are dosed at 800µg each, and we check erowid and 800 is a fairly strong dose, so we cut them in half to get a more moderate 400µg dose. I always like to err on the side of caution when dosing a new drug, especially one which is relatively new compared to things like LSD and psilocybin. Moo and I had heard that vasoconstriction can be an issue with NBOMe's and dark chocolate is both a vasodilator (sort of) and delicious, not that we needed a reason to eat some tasty chocolate, any vasodilation from the chocolate was certainly not a factor, but the psychological effect may have helped.\n",

Next comes on the body load people talk about. I experienced a bit of this on my first, and so far only, shroom trip, but this was much stronger and uncomfortable. I feel like I need to stretch all my muscles, especially my legs, feet, wrists and neck. My back and abs feel like they need to be stretched as well, but in a weird way, they feel like they're made of stretchy rubber, stiff but malleable, and quite uncomfortable.\n",

The colours were astonishing and every frame blew my mind. Throughout the film I feel a deep connection to the movie and I empathize very strongly with the characters, having seen it once before, I spend more time analyzing the film and thinking of what the film represents. I'm not entirely sure, but I'm pretty sure the entire film is a metaphor for Indian history, I don't know much about indian history, so I'm hardly in a position to back up this theory. There are some sequences in Life of Pi which are simply stunning, I found my eyes watering because I couldn't blink for fear of missing anything, it was unreal. \n",

The 3-D seemed to be treated differently by my brain than real things, because when I looked around the theatre, things looked like they were in the red-blue style 3-D you see on paper, where everything is copied in another colour right besides itself, very cool. \n",

Normally you look straight ahead and focus on what you're looking directly at, but the 25C widened my field of view substantially, so much so that I could see the frame of my 3-D glasses clearly, even though they were right up against my face and normally not at all visible. Despite it widening my field of vision, it was super easily to be completely immersed in the movie, the film became my world, during the sad scenes I cried, and when things were looking up I felt happy to my core. The film was an emotional journey I will never forget, owing largely to the 25C alowing me to live in the film.\n",

Coolest were the legacy sculptures and pavilions from the olympics. The sculptures were very striking and interesting. We climbed above a very cool restaurant, and probably spent a good half hour laughing at the word Beeth, which is the natural plural form of booth, as in \"which booth would you like? we have any available beeth\". \n",

Along the water we spot a raccoon, we laugh at the way raccoons look, and upon turning around, the racoon must have climbed down a ladder from the seawall to the shoreline, which is pretty cool. Then we followed the raccoon along the shore while he searched for food. We talked a lot about how cool raccoons are, and how cute they are. We walked off to check out some cool little areas and interesting buildings, and when we came back to the shore, about 400 metres down the shore, we look down, and we walked straight to where the same raccoon was. This ridiculous coincidence blew our minds and we were super stoked on finding the little guy. After following him a bit more, we walk back into the city and start heading home to the bus stop, it's about 3:30 at this point, and we're still tripping. The weed is definitely making us a little hungry, and while I'm not really interested in eating, a part of me wants to get some food in my body. We find a little breakfast place and grab a sandwich. After eating we head home and marvel at the giant circle we made throughout the night, starting and finishing at the same spot.

I really liked the high, but the come up really wasn't fun, the body feelings were quite unpleasant for the first hour or so. The vasoconstriction wasn't bad, but I could feel my hands and feet were pretty cold, and getting inside and warming up I could see that my hands didn't have the best circulation, stretching a rubbing my hands helps push blood around, I wouldn't do too much more than 400µg unless it's quite warm outside because the vasoconstriction was no joke. I will definitely be doing this drug again, and at the same dosage, I really liked the intensity and duration at 400µg, but I am quite sensitive to psychedelics so some may prefer a couple µg more.\n",

The fan boys won't be happy unless they get MS office for free or at a normal app price. A 10 hour rate I think is pretty dumb, won't make much revenue and it probably cost more to develop the app then they will get in return. I would have recommended that MS build a full MS office for iPad and release that after they launch Windows 8. Launch W8 as a business tablet running legacy apps and it will be more appealing to businesses thus they invest in them, the connectivity with the desktop would get them to upgrade their OS, then when enough have switched to win 8 then release the iPad version of MS office, there should be a strong competition between W8 and IOS where android is the bottom player.
